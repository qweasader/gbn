Coppeard discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting
enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1574)

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow during CSS manipulation. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1576)

Holger Fuhrmannek discovered an out-of-bounds read with Web Audio. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting
enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal sensitive
information. (CVE-2014-1577)

Abhishek Arya discovered an out-of-bounds write when buffering WebM video

crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

A use-after-free was discovered during text layout in some circumstances.
If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with
scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with

Eric Shepherd and Jan-Ivar Bruaroey discovered issues with video sharing
via WebRTC in iframes, where video continues to be shared after being
stopped and navigating to a new site doesn't turn off the camera. An
attacker could potentially exploit this to access the camera without the
user being aware. (CVE-2014-1585, CVE-2014-1586)");
