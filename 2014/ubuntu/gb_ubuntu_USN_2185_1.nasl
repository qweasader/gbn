Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd, John Schoenick, Karl Tomlinson, Vladimir
Vukicevic and Christian Holler discovered multiple memory safety issues in
Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,
an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service
via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2014-1518, CVE-2014-1519)

An out of bounds read was discovered in Web Audio. An attacker could
potentially exploit this cause a denial of service via application crash
or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1522)

Abhishek Arya discovered an out of bounds read when decoding JPG images.
An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via application crash. (CVE-2014-1523)

Abhishek Arya discovered a buffer overflow when a script uses a non-XBL
object as an XBL object. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2014-1524)

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Text Track Manager when
processing HTML video. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause
a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2014-1525)

Jukka Jylanki discovered an out-of-bounds write in Cairo when working
with canvas in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit
this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2014-1528)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that sites with notification permissions can
run script in a privileged context in some circumstances. An attacker
could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2014-1529)

It was discovered that browser history navigations could be used to load
a site with the addressbar displaying the wrong address. An attacker could
potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting or phishing
attacks. (CVE-2014-1530)

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing images in some
circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2014-1531)

Christian Heimes discovered that NSS did not handle IDNA domain prefixes
correctly for wildcard certificates. An attacker could potentially exploit
this by using a specially crafted certificate to conduct a machine-in-the-middle
attack. (CVE-2014-1492)

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free during
host resolution in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
