tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

process. (CVE-2014-3178, CVE-2014-3190, CVE-2014-3191, CVE-2014-3192)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of
service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3179,
CVE-2014-3200)

It was discovered that Chromium did not properly handle the interaction of
IPC and V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3188)

A use-after-free was discovered in the web workers implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,
an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3194)

It was discovered that V8 did not correctly handle Javascript heap
allocations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
steal sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3195)

It was discovered that Blink did not properly provide substitute data for
pages blocked by the XSS auditor. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
steal sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3197)

It was discovered that the wrap function for Event's in the V8 bindings
in Blink produced an erroneous result in some circumstances. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service by stopping a worker
process that was handling an Event object. (CVE-2014-3199)

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via
renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7967)");
