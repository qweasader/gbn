  # - Unlike other VTs we're using the CVEs line by line here for easier addition of new CVEs / to
  #   avoid too large diffs
  # - Some of the CVEs are about access with/via ro (read only) with a score of 7.5 while others are
  #   for rw access (read write) with a score of 10.0. As we can't differentiate between both we use
  #   the lower score here.

  script_tag(name:"impact", value:"If an attacker is able to guess a PUBLIC community string, they
  would be able to read SNMP data (depending on which MIBs are installed) from the remote device.
  This information might include system time, IP addresses, interfaces, processes running, etc.

  If an attacker is able to guess a PRIVATE community string (WRITE or 'writeall' access), they will
  have the ability to change information on the remote machine. This could be a huge security hole,
  enabling remote attackers to wreak complete havoc such as routing network traffic, initiating
  processes, etc. In essence, 'writeall' access will give the remote attacker full administrative
  rights over the remote machine.

  Note that this test only gathers information and does not attempt to write to the remote device.
  Thus it is not possible to determine automatically whether the reported community is public or
  private.

  Also note that information made available through a guessable community string might or might not
  contain sensitive data. Please review the information available through the reported community
  string to determine the impact of this disclosure.");
