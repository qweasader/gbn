CVE-2014-3513

A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed the DTLS Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension data. A remote attacker could send multiple specially crafted handshake messages to exhaust all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server.

CVE-2014-3566 ('POODLE')

A flaw was found in the way SSL 3.0 handled padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

This update adds support for Fallback SCSV to mitigate this issue.

CVE-2014-3567

A memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed session ticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number of invalid session tickets to that server.

CVE-2014-3568

When OpenSSL is configured with 'no-ssl3' as a build option, servers could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be configured to send them.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u13.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.0.1j-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.");
