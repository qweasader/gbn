CVE-2014-0480

Florian Apolloner discovered that in certain situations, URL reversing could generate scheme-relative URLs which could unexpectedly redirect a user to a different host, leading to phishing attacks.

CVE-2014-0481

David Wilson reported a file upload denial of service vulnerability. Django's file upload handling in its default configuration may degrade to producing a huge number of `os.stat()` system calls when a duplicate filename is uploaded. A remote attacker with the ability to upload files can cause poor performance in the upload handler, eventually causing it to become very slow.

CVE-2014-0482

David Greisen discovered that under some circumstances, the use of the RemoteUserMiddleware middleware and the RemoteUserBackend authentication backend could result in one user receiving another user's session, if a change to the REMOTE_USER header occurred without corresponding logout/login actions.

CVE-2014-0483

Collin Anderson discovered that it is possible to reveal any field's data by modifying the popup and to_field parameters of the query string on an admin change form page. A user with access to the admin interface, and with sufficient knowledge of model structure and the appropriate URLs, could construct popup views which would display the values of non-relationship fields, including fields the application developer had not intended to expose in such a fashion.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.5-1+deb7u8.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.6.6-1.
