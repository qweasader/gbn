CVE-2001-1593

The spy_user function which is called when a2ps is invoked with the --debug flag insecurely used temporary files.

CVE-2014-0466

Brian M. Carlson reported that a2ps's fixps script does not invoke gs with the -dSAFER option. Consequently executing fixps on a malicious PostScript file could result in files being deleted or arbitrary commands being executed with the privileges of the user running fixps.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 1:4.14-1.1+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in version 1:4.14-1.1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your a2ps packages.");
