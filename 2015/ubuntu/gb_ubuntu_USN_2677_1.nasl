tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1270)

A use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1272)

A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1276)

A use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1277)

A memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked
in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.

It was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of
a microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. (CVE-2015-1281)

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
the program. (CVE-2015-1283)

It was discovered that Blink did not enforce a page's maximum number of
frames in some circumstances, resulting in a use-after-free. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,
or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render
