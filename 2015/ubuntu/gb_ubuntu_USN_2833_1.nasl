discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Firefox. (CVE-2015-7201, CVE-2015-7202)

Ronald Crane discovered three buffer overflows through code inspection.
If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an
attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7203, CVE-2015-7220, CVE-2015-7221)

Cajus Pollmeier discovered a crash during javascript variable assignments
in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
(CVE-2015-7204)

Ronald Crane discovered a buffer overflow through code inspection. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7205)

It was discovered that it is possible to read cross-origin URLs following
a redirect if performance.getEntries() is used with an iframe to host a
page. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an
attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin
restrictions. (CVE-2015-7207)

It was discovered that Firefox allows for control characters to be set in
cookies. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cookie
injection attacks on some web servers. (CVE-2015-7208)

Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free in WebRTC when closing channels in
some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7210)

Abdulrahman Alqabandi discovered that hash symbol is incorrectly handled
when parsing data: URLs. An attacker could potentially exploit this to
conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2015-7211)

Abhishek Arya discovered an integer overflow when allocating large
textures. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7212)

Ronald Crane discovered an integer overflow when processing MP4 format
video in some circumstances. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
