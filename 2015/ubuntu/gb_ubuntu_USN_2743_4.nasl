Original advisory details:

 Andrew Osmond, Olli Pettay, Andrew Sutherland, Christian Holler, David
 Major, Andrew McCreight, Cameron McCormack, Bob Clary and Randell Jesup
 discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
 potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
 crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Firefox. (CVE-2015-4500, CVE-2015-4501)

 Andre Bargull discovered that when a web page creates a scripted proxy
 for the window with a handler defined a certain way, a reference to the
 inner window will be passed, rather than that of the outer window.
 (CVE-2015-4502)

 Felix Grobert discovered an out-of-bounds read in the QCMS color
 management library in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to
 opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit
 this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or obtain
 sensitive information. (CVE-2015-4504)

 Khalil Zhani discovered a buffer overflow when parsing VP9 content in some
 circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
 website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of
 service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4506)

 Spandan Veggalam discovered a crash while using the debugger API in some
 circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
 website whilst using the debugger, an attacker could potentially exploit
 this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
 Firefox. (CVE-2015-4507)

 Juho Nurminen discovered that the URL bar could display the wrong URL in
 reader mode in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
 specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
 conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2015-4508)

 A use-after-free was discovered when manipulating HTML media content in
 some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially
 crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a
 denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with
 the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4509)

 Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free when using a shared worker with
 IndexedDB in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
 specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
 cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code
 with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
