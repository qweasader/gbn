implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6765,
CVE-2015-6766, CVE-2015-6767)

Several security issues were discovered in the DOM implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass same
origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6768, CVE-2015-6770)

A security issue was discovered in the provisional-load commit
implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6769)

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the array map and filter
operations in V8 in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to
opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash.
(CVE-2015-6771)

It was discovered that the DOM implementation in Chromium does not prevent
javascript: URL navigation while a document is being detached. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.
(CVE-2015-6772)

An out-of bounds read was discovered in Skia in some circumstances. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer
crash. (CVE-2015-6773)

A use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Chromium. If
a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer
crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed
render process. (CVE-2015-6777)

It was discovered that the Document::open function in Chromium did not
ensure that page-dismissal event handling is compatible with modal dialog
blocking. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof application
UI content. (CVE-2015-6782)

It was discovered that the page serializer in Chromium mishandled MOTW
comments for URLs in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially
exploit this to inject HTML content. (CVE-2015-6784)

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
in Chromium accepted an x.y hostname as a match for a *.x.y pattern. An
attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended access
restrictions. (CVE-2015-6785)

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
in Chromium accepted blob:, data: and filesystem: URLs as ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
