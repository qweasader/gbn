CVE-2015-0556

Jakub Wilk discovered that arj follows symlinks created during unpacking of an arj archive. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a directory traversal attack if a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.

CVE-2015-0557

Jakub Wilk discovered that arj does not sufficiently protect from directory traversal while unpacking an arj archive containing file paths with multiple leading slashes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to write to arbitrary files if a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.

CVE-2015-2782

Jakub Wilk and Guillem Jover discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in arj. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running arj.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in version 3.10.22-10+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in version 3.10.22-13.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.10.22-13.

We recommend that you upgrade your arj packages.");
