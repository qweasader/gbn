  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"As discussed upstream, a flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote configuration packets. Note that remote configuration is disabled by default in NTP. (CVE-2015-5146)

It was found that the :config command can be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). (CVE-2015-7703)

It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands. (CVE-2015-5194)

It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command. (CVE-2015-5195)

It was discovered that sntp would hang in an infinite loop when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion of the precision value in the packet to double. (CVE-2015-5219)

A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5 symmetric keys on big-endian systems. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to guess generated MD5 keys, which could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server. (CVE-2015-3405)");
