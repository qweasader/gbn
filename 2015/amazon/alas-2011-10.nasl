  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) registry implementation. A remote RMI client could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the RMI server running the registry. (CVE-2011-3556)

A flaw was found in the Java RMI registry implementation. A remote RMI client could use this flaw to execute code on the RMI server with unrestricted privileges. (CVE-2011-3557)

A flaw was found in the IIOP (Internet Inter-Orb Protocol) deserialization code. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions by deserializing specially-crafted input. (CVE-2011-3521)

It was found that the Java ScriptingEngine did not properly restrict the privileges of sandboxed applications. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2011-3544)

A flaw was found in the AWTKeyStroke implementation. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2011-3548)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the Java2D code used to perform transformations of graphic shapes and images. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2011-3551)

An insufficient error checking flaw was found in the unpacker for JAR files in pack200 format. A specially-crafted JAR file could use this flaw to crash the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with JVM privileges. (CVE-2011-3554)

It was found that HttpsURLConnection did not perform SecurityManager checks in the setSSLSocketFactory method. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass connection restrictions defined in the policy. (CVE-2011-3560)

A flaw was found in the way the SSL 3 and TLS 1.0 protocols used block ciphers in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. An attacker able to perform a chosen plain text attack against a connection mixing trusted and untrusted data could use this flaw to recover portions of the trusted data sent over the connection. (CVE-2011-3389)

Note: This update mitigates the CVE-2011-3389 issue by splitting the first application data record byte to a separate SSL/TLS protocol record. This mitigation may cause compatibility issues with some SSL/TLS implementations and can be disabled using the jsse.enableCBCProtection boolean property. This can be done on the command line by appending the flag '-Djsse.enableCBCProtection=false' to the java command.

An information leak flaw was found in the InputStream.skip implementation. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to obtain bytes skipped by other threads. (CVE-2011-3547)

A flaw was found in the Java HotSpot virtual machine. An untrusted Java application or applet could ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
