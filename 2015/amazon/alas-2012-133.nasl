A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected 32-bit systems. (CVE-2012-2384, Moderate)

A memory leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled resource clean up in the mmap() failure path when the MAP_HUGETLB flag was set. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2390, Moderate)

A race condition was found in the way access to inet->opt ip_options was synchronized in the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. Depending on the network facing applications running on the system, a remote attacker could possibly trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service regardless of the applications the system runs. (CVE-2012-3552, Moderate)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's dl2k driver, used by certain D-Link Gigabit Ethernet adapters, restricted IOCTLs. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to issue potentially harmful IOCTLs, which could cause Ethernet adapters using the dl2k driver to malfunction (for example, losing network connectivity). (CVE-2012-2313, Low)

A flaw was found in the way the msg_namelen variable in the rds_recvmsg() function of the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation was initialized. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space. (CVE-2012-3430, Low)");
