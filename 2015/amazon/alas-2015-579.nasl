An httpd module using this API function could consequently allow access that should have been denied. (CVE-2015-3185)

Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way httpd generated certain error responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw crash the httpd child process using a request that triggers a certain HTTP error. (CVE-2015-0253)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the mod_lua httpd module processed certain WebSocket Ping requests. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted WebSocket Ping packet that would cause the httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2015-0228)");
