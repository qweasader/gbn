A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the cups web templating engine. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the default configuration settings that bind the CUPS scheduler to the 'localhost' or loopback interface. (CVE-2015-1159)

An integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way cups handled compressed raster image files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted image file, which when passed via the cups Raster filter, could cause the cups filter to crash. (CVE-2014-9679)");
