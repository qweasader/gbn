If an application used such a function, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2013-4332)

A flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process multibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash. (CVE-2013-0242)

It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)");
