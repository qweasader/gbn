  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"IPv6 fragment identification value generation could allow a remote attacker to disrupt a target system's networking, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services. (CVE-2011-2699, Important)

A signedness issue was found in the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation. A malicious CIFS server could send a specially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in a denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS share mounted. (CVE-2011-3191, Important)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled fragmented IPv6 UDP datagrams over the bridge with UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) functionality on. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4326, Important)

The way IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs were generated could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and possibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs are now more random. (CVE-2011-3188, Moderate)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) implementation. A local user in the fuse group who has access to mount a FUSE file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3353, Moderate)

A flaw was found in the b43 driver in the Linux kernel. If a system had an active wireless interface that uses the b43 driver, an attacker able to send a specially-crafted frame to that interface could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3359, Moderate)

A flaw was found in the way CIFS shares with DFS referrals at their root were handled. An attacker on the local network who is able to deploy a malicious CIFS server could create a CIFS network share that, when mounted, would cause the client system to crash. (CVE-2011-3363, Moderate)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled VLAN 0 frames with the priority tag set. When using certain network drivers, an attacker on the local network could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3593, Moderate)

A flaw in the way memory containing security-related data was handled in tpm_read() could allow a local, unprivileged user to read the results of a previously run TPM command. (CVE-2011-1162, Low)

A heap overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT) implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partition tables. (CVE-2011-1577, Low)

The I/O statistics from the taskstats subsystem could be read without any restrictions. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to gather confidential information, such as the length of a password used in a process. (CVE-2011-2494, Low)

It was found that the perf tool, a part of the Linux kernel's Performance Events implementation, could load its configuration file from the ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
