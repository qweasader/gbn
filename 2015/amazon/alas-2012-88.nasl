A malicious Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions or modify immutable object data. (CVE-2012-1711, CVE-2012-1719)

It was discovered that the SynthLookAndFeel class from Swing did not properly prevent access to certain UI elements from outside the current application context. A malicious Java application or applet could use this flaw to crash the Java Virtual Machine, or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-1716)

Multiple flaws were discovered in the font manager's layout lookup implementation. A specially-crafted font file could cause the Java Virtual Machine to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the virtual machine. (CVE-2012-1713)

Multiple flaws were found in the way the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine verified the bytecode of the class file to be executed. A specially-crafted Java application or applet could use these flaws to crash the Java Virtual Machine, or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-1723, CVE-2012-1725)

It was discovered that the Java XML parser did not properly handle certain XML documents. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially-crafted XML file could use this flaw to make the XML parser enter an infinite loop. (CVE-2012-1724)

It was discovered that the Java security classes did not properly handle Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL). CRL containing entries with duplicate certificate serial numbers could have been ignored. (CVE-2012-1718)

It was discovered that various classes of the Java Runtime library could create temporary files with insecure permissions. A local attacker could use this flaw to gain access to the content of such temporary files. (CVE-2012-1717)");
