If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the manager web interface, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's manager interface session. (CVE-2012-4558)

It was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive, a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-1862)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_info, mod_status, mod_imagemap, mod_ldap, and mod_proxy_ftp modules. An attacker could possibly use these flaws to perform XSS attacks if they were able to make the victim's browser generate an HTTP request with a specially-crafted Host header. (CVE-2012-3499)");
