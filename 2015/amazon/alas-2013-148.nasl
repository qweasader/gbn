A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the TCP Illinois congestion control algorithm implementation in the Linux kernel. If the TCP Illinois congestion control algorithm were in use (the sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control variable set to 'illinois'), a local, unprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-4565, Moderate)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way a new node's hot added memory was propagated to other nodes' zonelists. By utilizing this newly added memory from one of the remaining nodes, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-5517, Moderate)

It was found that a previous kernel release did not correctly fix the CVE-2009-4307 issue, a divide-by-zero flaw in the ext4 file system code. A local, unprivileged user with the ability to mount an ext4 file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2100, Low)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation handled overlapping, fragmented IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to bypass protection mechanisms (such as a firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS)) when sending network packets to a target system. (CVE-2012-4444, Low)");
