It was discovered that libwmf did not properly process certain WMF files.

It was discovered that libwmf did not properly process certain WMF files. By tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted WMF file in an application using libwmf, a remote attacker could possibly exploit this flaw to cause a crash. (CVE-2015-4695)

The gdPngReadData function in libgd 2.0.34 allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted PNG image with truncated data, which causes an infinite loop in the png_read_info function in libpng. (CVE-2007-2756)

Buffer overflow in the gdImageStringFTEx function in gdft.c in GD Graphics Library 2.0.33 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted string with a JIS encoded font. (CVE-2007-0455)

The _gdGetColors function in gd_gd.c in PHP 5.2.11 and 5.3.x before 5.3.1, and the GD Graphics Library 2.x, does not properly verify a certain colorsTotal structure member, which might allow remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow or buffer over-read attacks via a crafted GD file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-3293. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. (CVE-2009-3546)

Integer overflow in gdImageCreateTrueColor function in the GD Graphics Library (libgd) before 2.0.35 allows user-assisted remote attackers to have unspecified attack vectors and impact. (CVE-2007-3472)

The gdImageCreateXbm function in the GD Graphics Library (libgd) before 2.0.35 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving a gdImageCreate failure. (CVE-2007-3473)");
