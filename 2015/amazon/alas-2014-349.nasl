  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, the server must be using OpenSSL version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of OpenSSL.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled invalid DTLS packet fragments. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on a DTLS client or server. (CVE-2014-0195)

Multiple flaws were found in the way OpenSSL handled read and write buffers when the SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS mode was enabled. A TLS/SSL client or server using OpenSSL could crash or unexpectedly drop connections when processing certain SSL traffic. (CVE-2010-5298, CVE-2014-0198)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain DTLS ServerHello requests. A specially crafted DTLS handshake packet could cause a DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2014-0221)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL performed anonymous Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchange. A specially crafted handshake packet could cause a TLS/SSL client that has the anonymous ECDH cipher suite enabled to crash. (CVE-2014-3470)

An integer underflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the way OpenSSL decoded certain base64 strings. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted base64 string via certain PEM processing routines that, when parsed by the OpenSSL library, would cause the OpenSSL server to crash.
