(dot dot) in a node name.

Puppet before 2.6.17 and 2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files on the puppet master server by leveraging an arbitrary user's certificate and private key in a GET request.

lib/puppet/ssl/certificate_authority.rb in Puppet before 2.6.17 and 2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, does not properly restrict the characters in the Common Name field of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to trick administrators into signing a crafted agent certificate via ANSI control sequences.

lib/puppet/defaults.rb in Puppet 2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, uses 0644 permissions for last_run_report.yaml, which allows local users to obtain sensitive configuration information by leveraging access to the puppet master server to read this file.");
