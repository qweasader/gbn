A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain SSLv2 messages. A malicious client could send a specially crafted SSLv2 CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message that would cause an OpenSSL server that both supports SSLv2 and enables EXPORT-grade cipher suites to crash. (CVE-2015-0293)

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way OpenSSL reused certain ASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted ASN.1 structure that, when parsed by an application, would cause that application to crash. (CVE-2015-0287)

A flaw was found in the ASN (Abstract Syntax Notation) parsing code of OpenSSL. An attacker could present a specially crafted certificate, which when verified by an OpenSSL client or server could cause it to crash. (CVE-2015-0286)

A null-pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain PKCS#7 blobs. An attacker could cause OpenSSL to crash, when applications verify, decrypt or parsed these ASN.1 encoded PKCS#7 blobs. OpenSSL clients and servers are not affected. (CVE-2015-0289)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenSSL's x509 certificate handling implementation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an OpenSSL server using an invalid certificate key. (CVE-2015-0288)");
