- rebuild

[253-11]
- backport changes to group parsing from version 254 to fix heap corruption
 when parsing nested groups (#444031)

[253-10]
- remove unnecessary nss_ldap linkage to libnsl (part of #427370)

[253-9]
- rebuild

[253-8]
- incorporate Tomas Janouseks fix to prevent re-use of connections across
 fork() (#252337)

[253-7]
- add keyutils-libs-devel and libselinux-devel as a buildrequires: in order to
 static link with newer Kerberos (#427370)

[253-6]
- suppress password-expired errors encountered during referral chases during
 modify requests (#335661)
- interpret server-supplied policy controls when chasing referrals, so that
 we don't give up when following a referral for a password change after
 reset (#335661)
- don't attempt to change the password using ldap_modify if the password
 change mode is 'exop_send_old' (we already didn't for 'exop') (#364501)
- don't drop the supplied password if the directory server indicates that
 the password needs to be changed because its just been reset: we may need
 it to chase a referral later (#335661)
- correctly detect libresolv and build a URI using discovered settings, so that
 server discovery can work again (#254172)
- honor the 'port' setting again by correctly detecting when a URI doesn't
 already specify one (#326351)");
