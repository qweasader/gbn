- Update summary and description to be vendor neutral

[2.0.52-1]
- When vm.sh does a status check and gets 'no state' it is now treated as a
 running state.
- Resolves: rhb#514044

[2.0.51-1]
- In some cases virtual machines will be restarted after a successful migration
 when the cluster configuration is updated.
- Resolves: rhbz#505340

[2.0.50-1]
- Extra checks from the oracle agents have been removed.
- Several fixes to prevent DOS attacks through insecure use of /tmp/ files have
 been implemented.
- vm.sh now uses libvirt
- Users can now define an explicit service processing order when
 central_processing is enabled
- Resolves: rhbz#470917 rhbz#412911 rhbz#468691 rhbz#492828

[2.0.49-1]
- Rgmanger now checks to see if it has been killed by the OOM killer and if
 so, reboots the node.
- Resolves: rhbz#488072

[2.0.48-1]
- clulog now accepts '-' as the first character in messages.
- If expire_time is 0 max_restarts is no longer ignored.
- SAP scripts have been updated.
- Empty PID files no longer cause resource start failures.
- Recovery policy of type restart now works properly when using a resource
 based on ra-skelet.sh
- startup_wait option has been added to the mysql resource agent.
- samba.sh now kills the pid listed in the proper pid file.
- Handling of '-F' has been improved to fix issues with rgmanager crashing if
 no members of a restricted failover domain are online and rgmanager failing
 to correctly restart service is they fail on the first node.
- Enabled ability to prioritize services.
- It is now possible to cap the number of simultaneious status checks to
 prevent load spikes.
- Enabling a frozen service no longer fails and leaves the service in a failed
 state.
- Forking and cloning during status checks has been optimized to reduce load
 spikes.
- rg_test no longer hangs when running against a cluster due to the removal
 of an 8MB memory cap.
- Resolves: rhbz#471431 rhbz#475826 rhbz#474444 rhbz#449394 rhbz#481058 rhbz#483093 rhbz#486711 rhbz#486717 rhbz#482858 rhbz#487598 rhbz#488714 rhbz#250718 rhbz#490455");
