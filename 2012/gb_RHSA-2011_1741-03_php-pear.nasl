  It was found that the 'pear' command created temporary files in an insecure
  way when installing packages. A malicious, local user could use this flaw
  to conduct a symbolic link attack, allowing them to overwrite the contents
  of arbitrary files accessible to the victim running the 'pear install'
  command. (CVE-2011-1072)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The php-pear package has been upgraded to version 1.9.4, which provides a
  number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#651897)

  * Prior to this update, php-pear created a cache in the
  '/var/cache/php-pear/' directory when attempting to list all packages. As a
  consequence, php-pear failed to create or update the cache file as a
  regular user without sufficient file permissions and could not list all
  packages. With this update, php-pear no longer fails if writing to the
  cache directory is not permitted. Now, all packages are listed as expected.
  (BZ#747361)

  All users of php-pear are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects these issues.");
