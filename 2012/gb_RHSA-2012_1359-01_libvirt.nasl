  A flaw was found in libvirtd's RPC call handling. An attacker able to
  establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash
  libvirtd by sending an RPC message that has an event as the RPC number, or
  an RPC number that falls into a gap in the RPC dispatch table.
  (CVE-2012-4423)

  This issue was discovered by Wenlong Huang of the Red Hat Virtualization QE
  Team.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When the host_uuid option was present in the libvirtd.conf file, the
  augeas libvirt lens was unable to parse the file. This bug has been fixed
  and the augeas libvirt lens now parses libvirtd.conf as expected in the
  described scenario. (BZ#858988)

  * When a virtual machine was started with an image chain using block
  devices and a block rebase operation was issued, the operation failed on
  completion in the blockJobAbort() function. This update relabels and
  configures cgroups for the backing files and the rebase operation now
  succeeds. (BZ#860720)

  All users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  the updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.");
