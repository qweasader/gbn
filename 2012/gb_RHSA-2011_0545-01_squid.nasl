  supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

  It was found that string comparison functions in Squid did not properly
  handle the comparisons of NULL and empty strings. A remote, trusted web
  client could use this flaw to cause the squid daemon to crash via a
  specially-crafted request. (CVE-2010-3072)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * A small memory leak in Squid caused multiple 'ctx: enter level' messages
  to be logged to '/var/log/squid/cache.log'. This update resolves the memory
  leak. (BZ#666533)

  * This erratum upgrades Squid to upstream version 3.1.10. This upgraded
  version supports the Google Instant service and introduces various code
  improvements. (BZ#639365)

  Users of squid should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these
  issues. After installing this update, the squid service will be restarted
  automatically.");
