Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path
 under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the
 current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
 (CVE-2008-5983)

 It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input
 validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a
 crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via
 application crash. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)

 Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.
 A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via
 daemon outage. (CVE-2010-3493)

 It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform
 input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could
 potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. (CVE-2011-1015)

 Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process
 Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote
 attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a
 denial of service. (CVE-2011-1521)

 It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in
 the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this
 to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7
 users. (CVE-2011-4940)

 It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when
 creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain
 sensitive information. (CVE-2011-4944)

 It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its
 input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit
 this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.
 (CVE-2012-0845)

 It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values
 without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If
 a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML
 file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive
 CPU resources. (CVE-2012-0876)

 Tim Body discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly
 handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or
 application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an
 attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory
 resources. (CVE-2012-1148)");
