Sutherland, Jason Smith, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel
Holbert discovered memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user
were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could
exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1970, CVE-2012-1971)

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the
user were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker
could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or
potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1972, CVE-2012-1973, CVE-2012-1974, CVE-2012-1975,

Mariusz Mlynsk discovered that it is possible to shadow the location object
using Object.defineProperty. This could potentially result in a cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack against plugins. With cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted
E-Mail, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents or
steal confidential data within the same domain. (CVE-2012-1956)

Frederic Hoguin discovered that bitmap format images with a negative height
could potentially result in memory corruption. If the user were tricked
into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3966)

It was discovered that Thunderbird's WebGL implementation was vulnerable to
multiple memory safety issues. If the user were tricked into opening a
specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial
of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3967, CVE-2012-3968)

Arthur Gerkis discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird's
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) implementation. If the user were tricked
into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit these to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute
code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3969,
CVE-2012-3970)

Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in the bundled
Graphite 2 library. If the user were tricked into opening a specially
crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of
service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3971)
