current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2008-5983)

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input
validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a
crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via
application crash. These issues only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when
creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2011-4944)

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its
input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit
this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.
An attacker could cause a denial of service under certain circumstances.
This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the
PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime
objects with an unpredictable value. (CVE-2012-1150)

Serhiy Storchaka discovered that the UTF16 decoder in Python did not
properly reset internal variables after error handling. An attacker could
exploit this to cause a denial of service via memory corruption.
