handling of IPv4 icmp packets. A remote user could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1927)

Vegard Nossum discovered a leak in the kernel's inotify_init() system call.
A local, unprivileged user could exploit this to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2010-4250)

An error was discovered in the kernel's handling of CUSE (Character device
in Userspace). A local attacker might exploit this flaw to escalate
privilege, if access to /dev/cuse has been modified to allow non-root
users. (CVE-2010-4650)

A flaw was found in the kernel's Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA).
Changes made by an attacker might not be discovered by IMA, if SELinux was
disabled, and a new IMA rule was loaded. (CVE-2011-0006)

A flaw was found in the Linux Ethernet bridge's handling of IGMP (Internet
Group Management Protocol) packets. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2011-0716)

Dan Rosenberg reported errors in the OSS (Open Sound System) MIDI
interface. A local attacker on non-x86 systems might be able to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1476)

Dan Rosenberg reported errors in the kernel's OSS (Open Sound System)
driver for Yamaha FM synthesizer chips. A local user can exploit this to
cause memory corruption, causing a denial of service or privilege
escalation. (CVE-2011-1477)

Dan Rosenberg reported an error in the old ABI compatibility layer of ARM
kernels. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1759)

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the kernel's handling of corrupt LDM
partitions. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service or
escalate privileges. (CVE-2011-2182)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's AppArmor security interface
when invalid information was written to it. An unprivileged local user
could use this to cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2011-3619)

It was discovered that some import kernel threads can be blocked by a user
level process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4621)

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a
specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on
the system. (CVE-2012-0038)

Chen Haogang discovered an integer overflow that could result in memory
corruption. A local unprivileged user could use this to crash the system.
