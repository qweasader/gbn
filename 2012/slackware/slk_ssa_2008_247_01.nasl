Please note that this is the FINAL release of PHP4, and it has already passed
the announced end-of-life. Sites should seriously consider migrating to PHP5
rather than upgrading to php-4.4.9.


Here are the details from the Slackware 11.0 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/php-4.4.9-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
 Upgraded to php-4.4.9. This upgrades the bundled PCRE library to fix
 security issues, as well as fixing a few other security related bugs.
 See the PHP4 ChangeLog for more details:
 [link moved to references]
 Please note: PHP4 has been officially discontinued since last year, and
 reached the announced EOL on 2008-08-08. Sites should consider migrating
 to a supported release.
