  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number
  of system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for
  recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those
  involving broken shared libraries.

  A buffer underflow flaw was found in the way the uncompress utility of
  BusyBox expanded certain archive files compressed using Lempel-Ziv
  compression. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted
  archive file with uncompress, it could cause BusyBox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running BusyBox. (CVE-2006-1168)

  The BusyBox DHCP client, udhcpc, did not sufficiently sanitize certain
  options provided in DHCP server replies, such as the client hostname. A
  malicious DHCP server could send such an option with a specially-crafted
  value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was saved on the client
  system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a process that assumes the
  option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of that process. Note: udhcpc is not used on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux by default, and no DHCP client script is provided with the busybox
  packages. (CVE-2011-2716)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, 'findfs' command did not recognize Btrfs
  partitions. As a consequence, an error message could occur when dumping a
  core file. This update adds support for recognizing such partitions so
  the problem no longer occurs. (BZ#751927)

  * If the 'grep' command was used with the '-F' and '-i' options at the
  same time, the '-i' option was ignored. As a consequence, the 'grep -iF'
  command incorrectly performed a case-sensitive search instead of an
  insensitive search. A patch has been applied to ensure that the combination
  of the '-F' and '-i' options works as expected. (BZ#752134)

  * Prior to this update, the msh shell did not support the 'set -o pipefail'
  command. This update adds support for this command. (BZ#782018)

  * Previously, the msh shell could terminate unexpectedly with a
  segmentation fault when attempting to execute an empty command as a result
  of variable substitution (for example msh -c '$nonexistent_variable').
  With this update, msh has been modified to correctly interpret such
  commands and no longer crashes in this scenario.  ...
