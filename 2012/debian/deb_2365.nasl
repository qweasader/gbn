CVE-2011-3195

A possible shell insertion has been found in the mailing list handling.

CVE-2011-3196

Unix rights for the apache2.conf were set incorrectly (world readable).

CVE-2011-3197

Incorrect input sanitising for the $_SERVER['addrlink'] parameter could lead to SQL insertion.

CVE-2011-3198

DTC was using the -b option of htpasswd, possibly revealing password in clear text using ps or reading /proc.

CVE-2011-3199

A possible HTML/JavaScript insertion vulnerability has been found in the DNS & MX section of the user panel.

This update also fixes several vulnerabilities, for which no CVE ID has been assigned:

It has been discovered that DTC performs insufficient input sanitising in the package installer, leading to possible unwanted destination directory for installed packages if some DTC application packages are installed (note that these aren't available in Debian main).

DTC was setting-up /etc/sudoers with permissive sudo rights to chrootuid.

Incorrect input sanitizing in the package installer could lead to SQL insertion.

A malicious user could enter a specially crafted support ticket subject leading to an SQL injection in the draw_user_admin.php.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version 0.29.18-1+lenny2.

The stable distribution (squeeze) doesn't include dtc.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.34.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.");
