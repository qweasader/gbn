  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for libxkbcommon to version 0.8.2 fixes the following issues:

  - Fix a few NULL-dereferences, out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior
  in the XKB text format parser.

  - CVE-2018-15853: Endless recursion could have been used by local
  attackers to crash xkbcommon users by supplying a crafted keymap file
  that triggers boolean negation (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15854: Unchecked NULL pointer usage could have been used by
  local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser
  by supplying a crafted keymap file, because geometry tokens were
  desupported incorrectly (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15855: Unchecked NULL pointer usage could have been used by
  local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser
  by supplying a crafted keymap file, because the XkbFile for an
  xkb_geometry section was mishandled (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15856: An infinite loop when reaching EOL unexpectedly could be
  used by local attackers to cause a denial of service during parsing of
  crafted keymap files (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15857: An invalid free in ExprAppendMultiKeysymList could have
  been used by local attackers to crash xkbcommon keymap parsers or
  possibly have unspecified other impact by supplying a crafted keymap
  file (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15858: Unchecked NULL pointer usage when handling invalid
  aliases in CopyKeyAliasesToKeymap could have been used by local
  attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by
  supplying a crafted keymap file (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15859: Unchecked NULL pointer usage when parsing invalid atoms
  in ExprResolveLhs could have been used by local attackers to crash (NULL
  pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap
  file, because lookup failures are mishandled (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15861: Unchecked NULL pointer usage in ExprResolveLhs could
  have been used by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference)
  the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap file that triggers an
  xkb_intern_atom failure (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15862: Unchecked NULL pointer usage in LookupModMask could have
  been used by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the
  xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap file with invalid virtual
  modifiers (bsc#1105832).

  - CVE-2018-15863: Unchecked NULL pointer usage in ResolveStateAndPredicate
  could have been used by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer
  dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap file
  with a no-op modmask expression (b ...
