  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for haproxy to version 1.8.14 fixes the following issues:

  These security issues were fixed:

  - CVE-2018-14645: A flaw was discovered in the HPACK decoder what caused an
  out-of-bounds read in hpack_valid_idx() that resulted in a remote crash
  and denial of service (bsc#1108683)

  - CVE-2018-11469: Incorrect caching of responses to requests including an
  Authorization header allowed attackers to achieve information disclosure
  via an unauthenticated remote request (bsc#1094846).

  These non-security issues were fixed:

  - Require apparmor-abstractions to reduce dependencies (bsc#1100787)

  - hpack: fix improper sign check on the header index value

  - cli: make sure the 'getsock' command is only called on connections

  - tools: fix set_net_port() / set_host_port() on IPv4

  - patterns: fix possible double free when reloading a pattern list

  - server: Crash when setting FQDN via CLI.

  - kqueue: Don't reset the changes number by accident.

  - snapshot: take the proxy's lock while dumping errors

  - http/threads: atomically increment the error snapshot ID

  - dns: check and link servers' resolvers right after config parsing

  - h2: fix risk of memory leak on malformated wrapped frames

  - session: fix reporting of handshake processing time in the logs

  - stream: use atomic increments for the request counter

  - thread: implement HA_ATOMIC_XADD()

  - ECC cert should work with TLS   v1.2 and openssl  = 1.1.1

  - dns/server: fix incomatibility between SRV resolution and server state
  file

  - hlua: Don't call RESET_SAFE_LJMP if SET_SAFE_LJMP returns 0.

  - thread: lua: Wrong SSL context initialization.

  - hlua: Make sure we drain the output buffer when done.

  - lua: reset lua transaction between http requests

  - mux_pt: dereference the connection with care in mux_pt_wake()

  - lua: Bad HTTP client request duration.

  - unix: provide a - drain() function

  - Fix spelling error in configuration doc

  - cli/threads: protect some server commands against concurrent operations

  - cli/threads: protect all 'proxy' commands against concurrent updates

  - lua: socket timeouts are not applied

  - ssl: Use consistent naming for TLS protocols

  - dns: explain set server ... fqdn requires resolver

  - map: fix map_regm with backref

  - ssl: loading dh param from certifile causes unpredictable error.

  - ssl: fix missing error loading a keytype cert from a bundle.

  - ssl: empty connections reported as errors.

  - cli: make 'show fd' thread-safe

  - hathreads: implement a more flexible rendez-vous point

  - threads: fix the no-thread case after the change to the sync point
