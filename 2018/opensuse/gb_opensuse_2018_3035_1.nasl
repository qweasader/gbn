  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for gitolite fixes the following issues:

  Gitolite was updated to 3.6.9:

  - CVE-2018-16976: prevent racy access to repos in process of migration to
  gitolite (boo#1108272)

  - 'info' learns new '-p' option to show only physical repos (as opposed to
  wild repos)

  The update to 3.6.8 contains:

  - fix bug when deleting *all* hooks for a repo

  - allow trailing slashes in repo names

  - make pre-receive hook driver bail on non-zero exit of a pre-receive hook

  - allow templates in gitolite.conf (new feature)

  - various optimiations

  The update to 3.6.7 contains:

  - allow repo-specific hooks to be organised into subdirectories, and allow
  the multi-hook driver to be placed in some other location of your choice

  - allow simple test code to be embedded within the gitolite.conf file  see
  contrib/utils/testconf for how. (This goes on the client side, not on
  the server)

  - allow syslog 'facility' to be changed, from the default of 'local0'

  - allow syslog 'facility' to be changed, from the default of replaced with
  a space separated list of members

  The update to 3.6.6 contains:

  - simple but important fix for a future perl deprecation (perl will be
  removing '.' from @INC in 5.24)

  - 'perms' now requires a '-c' to activate batch mode (should not affect
  interactive use but check your scripts perhaps?)

  - gitolite setup now accepts a '-m' option to supply a custom message
  (useful when it is used by a script)
