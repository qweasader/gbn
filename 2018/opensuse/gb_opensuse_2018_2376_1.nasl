  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for libheimdal to version 7.5.0 fixes the following issues:

  The following security vulnerability was fixed:

  - CVE-2017-17439: Fixed a remote denial of service vulnerability through
  which remote unauthenticated attackers were able to crash the KDC by
  sending a crafted UDP packet containing empty data fields for client
  name or realm (boo#1071675)

  The following other bugs were fixed:

  - Override the build date (boo#1047218)

  - Use constant hostname (boo#1084909)

  - Handle long input lines when reloading database dumps

  - In pre-forked mode, correctly clear the process ids of exited children,
  allowing new child processes to replace the old.

  - Fixed incorrect KDC response when no-cross realm TGT exists, allowing
  client requests to fail quickly rather than time out after trying to get
  a correct answer from each KDC.

  Patch Instructions:

  To install this openSUSE Security Update use the SUSE recommended
  installation methods
  like YaST online_update or 'zypper patch'.
