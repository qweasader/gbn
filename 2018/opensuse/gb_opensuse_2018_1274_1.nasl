  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for xen to version 4.9.2 fixes several issues.

  This feature was added:

  - Added script, udev rule and systemd service to watch for vcpu
  online/offline events in a HVM domU. They are triggered via 'xl vcpu-set
  domU N'

  These security issues were fixed:

  - CVE-2018-8897: Prevent mishandling of debug exceptions on x86 (XSA-260,
  bsc#1090820)

  - Handle HPET timers in IO-APIC mode correctly to prevent malicious or
  buggy HVM guests from causing a hypervisor crash or potentially
  privilege escalation/information leaks (XSA-261, bsc#1090822)

  - Prevent unbounded loop, induced by qemu allowing an attacker to
  permanently keep a physical CPU core busy (XSA-262, bsc#1090823)

  - CVE-2018-10472: x86 HVM guest OS users (in certain configurations) were
  able to read arbitrary dom0 files via QMP live insertion of a CDROM, in
  conjunction with specifying the target file as the backing file of a
  snapshot (bsc#1089152).

  - CVE-2018-10471: x86 PV guest OS users were able to cause a denial of
  service (out-of-bounds zero write and hypervisor crash) via unexpected
  INT 80 processing, because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-5754
  (bsc#1089635).

  - CVE-2018-7540: x86 PV guest OS users were able to cause a denial of
  service (host OS CPU hang) via non-preemptible L3/L4 pagetable freeing
  (bsc#1080635).

  - CVE-2018-7541: Guest OS users were able to cause a denial of service
  (hypervisor crash) or gain privileges by triggering a grant-table
  transition from v2 to v1 (bsc#1080662).

  - CVE-2018-7542: x86 PVH guest OS users were able to cause a denial of
  service (NULL pointer dereference and hypervisor crash) by leveraging
  the mishandling
  of configurations that lack a Local APIC (bsc#1080634).

  These non-security issues were fixed:

  - bsc#1087252: Update built-in defaults for xenstored in stubdom, keep
  default to run xenstored as daemon in dom0

  - bsc#1087251: Preserve xen-syms from xen-dbg.gz to allow processing
  vmcores with crash(1)

  - bsc#1072834: Prevent unchecked MSR access error

  This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:Update update project.
