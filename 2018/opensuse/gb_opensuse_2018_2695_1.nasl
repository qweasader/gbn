  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for compat-openssl098 fixes the following security issues:

  - CVE-2018-0732: During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E)
  based ciphersuite a malicious server could have sent a very large prime
  value to the client. This caused the client to spend an unreasonably
  long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang
  until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of
  Service attack (bsc#1097158)

  - Blinding enhancements for ECDSA and DSA (bsc#1097624, bsc#1098592)

  - CVE-2018-0737: The RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be
  vulnerable to a cache timing side channel attack. An attacker with
  sufficient access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key
  generation process could have recovered the private key (bsc#1089039)

  - CVE-2018-0739: Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such
  as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given
  malicious input with excessive recursion. This could have resulted in
  DoS (bsc#1087102).

  This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.
