  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for tomcat to version 9.0.10 fixes the following issues:

  Security issues fixed:

  - CVE-2018-1336: An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with
  supplementary characters could have lead to an infinite loop in the
  decoder causing a Denial of Service (bsc#1102400).

  - CVE-2018-8014: Fix insecure default CORS filter settings (bsc#1093697).

  - CVE-2018-8034: The host name verification when using TLS with the
  WebSocket client was missing. It is now enabled by default (bsc#1102379).

  - CVE-2018-8037: If an async request was completed by the application at
  the same time as the container triggered the async timeout, a race
  condition existed that could have resulted in a user seeing a response
  intended for a different user. An additional issue was present in the
  NIO and NIO2 connectors that did not correctly track the closure of the
  connection when an async request was completed by the application and
  timed out by the container at the same time. This could also have
  resulted in a user seeing a response intended for another user
  (bsc#1102410).

  Bug fixes:

  - Avoid overwriting of customer's configuration during update (bsc#1067720)

  - Disable adding OSGi metadata to JAR files
