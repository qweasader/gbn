  Security issues fixed:

  - CVE-2018-3780: Fixed a missing sanitization of search results for an
  autocomplete field that could lead to a stored XSS requiring
  user-interaction. The missing sanitization only affected user names,
  hence malicious search results could only be crafted by authenticated
  users. (boo#1105598)


  Other bugs fixed:

  - Fix highlighting of the upload drop zone

  - Apply ldapUserFilter on members of group

  - Make the DELETION of groups match greedy on the groupID

  - Add parent index to share table

  - Log full exception in cron instead of only the message

  - Properly lock the target file on dav upload when not using part files

  - LDAP backup server should not be queried when auth fails

  - Fix filenames in sharing integration tests

  - Lower log level for quota manipulation cases

  - Let user set avatar in nextcloud if LDAP provides invalid image data

  - Improved logging of smb connection errors

  - Allow admin to disable fetching of avatars as well as a specific
  attribute

  - Allow to disable encryption

  - Update message shown when unsharing a file

  - Fixed English grammatical error on Settings page.

  - Request a valid property for DAV opendir

  - Allow updating the token on session regeneration

  - Prevent lock values from going negative with memcache backend

  - Correctly handle users with numeric user ids

  - Correctly parse the subject parameters for link (un)shares of calendars

  - Fix 'parsing' of email-addresses in comments and chat messages

  - Sanitize parameters in createSessionToken() while logging

  - Also retry rename operation on InvalidArgumentException

  - Improve url detection in comments

  - Only bind to ldap if configuration for the first server is set

  - Use download manager from PDF.js to download the file

  - Fix trying to load removed scripts

  - Only pull for new messages if the session is allowed to be kept alive

  - Always push object data
