CVE-2016-1000338

DSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of invisible data into a signed structure.

CVE-2016-1000339

Previously the primary engine class used for AES was AESFastEngine. Due to the highly table driven approach used in the algorithm it turns out that if the data channel on the CPU can be monitored the lookup table accesses are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being used. There was also a leak in AESEngine although it was substantially less. AESEngine has been modified to remove any signs of leakage and is now the primary AES class for the BC JCE provider. Use of AESFastEngine is now only recommended where otherwise deemed appropriate.

CVE-2016-1000341

DSA signature generation is vulnerable to timing attack. Where timings can be closely observed for the generation of signatures, the lack of blinding may allow an attacker to gain information about the signature's k value and ultimately the private value as well.

CVE-2016-1000342

ECDSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of invisible data into a signed structure.

CVE-2016-1000343

The DSA key pair generator generates a weak private key if used with default values. If the JCA key pair generator is not explicitly initialised with DSA parameters, 1.55 and earlier generates a private value assuming a 1024 bit key size. In earlier releases this can be dealt with by explicitly passing parameters to the key pair generator.

CVE-2016-1000345

The DHIES/ECIES CBC mode is vulnerable to padding oracle attack. In an environment where timings can be easily observed, it is possible with enough observations to identify when the decryption is failing due to padding.

CVE-2016-1000346

In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider the other party DH public key is not fully validated. This can cause issues as invalid keys can be used to reveal details about the other party's private key where static Diffie-Hellman is in use. As of this release the key parameters are checked on agreement calculation.

For Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version 1.49+dfsg-3+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your bouncycastle packages.
