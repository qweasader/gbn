  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Two flaws were discovered in ruby-passenger for Ruby Rails and Rack support that allowed attackers to spoof HTTP headers or exploit a race condition which made privilege escalation under certain conditions possible.

CVE-2015-7519

Remote attackers could spoof headers passed to applications by using an underscore character instead of a dash character in an HTTP header as demonstrated by an X_User header.

CVE-2018-12029

A vulnerability was discovered by the Pulse Security team. It was exploitable only when running a non-standard passenger_instance_registry_dir, via a race condition where after a file was created, there was a window in which it could be replaced with a symlink before it was chowned via the path and not the file descriptor. If the symlink target was to a file which would be executed by root such as root's crontab file, then privilege escalation was possible. This is now mitigated by using fchown().

For Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version 4.0.53-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-passenger packages.
