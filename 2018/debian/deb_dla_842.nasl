CVE-2017-2615

The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator in qemu-kvm is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data via bitblt copy in backward mode.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of qemu-kvm process on the host.

CVE-2017-2620

The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator in qemu-kvm is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data in cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of qemu-kvm process on the host.

CVE-2017-5898

The CCID Card device emulator support is vulnerable to an integer overflow flaw. It could occur while passing message via command/responses packets to and from the host.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the host resulting in a DoS.

This issue does not affect the qemu-kvm binaries in Debian but we apply the patch to the sources to stay in sync with the qemu package.

CVE-2017-5973

The USB xHCI controller emulator support in qemu-kvm is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing control transfer descriptors' sequence in xhci_kick_epctx.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process resulting in a DoS.

This update also updates the fix CVE-2016-9921 since it was too strict and broke certain guests.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u20.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
