CVE-2018-1000120

Duy Phan Thanh reported that curl could be fooled into writing a zero byte out of bounds when curl was told to work on an FTP URL, with the setting to only issue a single CWD command. The issue could be triggered if the directory part of the URL contained a '%00' sequence.

CVE-2018-1000121

Dario Weisser reported that curl might dereference a near-NULL address when getting an LDAP URL. A malicious server that sends a particularly crafted response could made crash applications that allowed LDAP URL relying on libcurl.

CVE-2018-1000122

OSS-fuzz and Max Dymond found that curl can be tricked into copying data beyond the end of its heap based buffer when asked to transfer an RTSP URL. curl could calculate a wrong data length to copy from the read buffer. This could lead to information leakage or a denial of service.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 7.26.0-1+wheezy25.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
