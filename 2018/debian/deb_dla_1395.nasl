CVE-2017-9774

A remote code execution vulnerability (RCE) that was exploitable by a logged-in user sending a maliciously crafted HTTP GET request to various image backends.

Note that the fix applied upstream has a regression in that it ignores the force aspect ratio option, see [link moved to references].

CVE-2017-14650

Another RCE that was exploitable by a logged-in user sending a maliciously crafted GET request specifically to the im image backend.

For Debian 8 Jessie, these issues have been fixed in php-horde-image version 2.1.0-4+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-horde-image packages.");
