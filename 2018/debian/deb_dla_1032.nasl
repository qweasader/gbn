For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 0.79.5+wheezy3. Note that later unattended-upgrades version released in later Debian versions do not exhibit the same behavior, as they use the release codename (e.g. jessie) instead of the suite name (e.g. oldstable) in the configuration file. So later releases will transition correctly for future LTS releases.

We recommend that you upgrade your unattended-upgrades packages.
