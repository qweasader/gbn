  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an extensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2016-6127

It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack if an attacker uploads a malicious file with a certain content type. Installations which use the AlwaysDownloadAttachments config setting are unaffected by this flaw. The applied fix addresses all existent and future uploaded attachments.

CVE-2017-5361

It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks for user passwords.

CVE-2017-5943

It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to an information leak of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) verification tokens if a user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted URL by an attacker.

CVE-2017-5944

It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to a remote code execution vulnerability in the dashboard subscription interface. A privileged attacker can take advantage of this flaw through carefully-crafted saved search names to cause unexpected code to be executed. The applied fix addresses all existent and future saved searches.

Additionally to the above mentioned CVEs, this update works around CVE-2015-7686 in Email::Address which could induce a denial of service of Request Tracker itself.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 4.0.7-5+deb7u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.
