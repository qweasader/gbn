  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A server-side request forgery vulnerability was reported for the setup script in phpmyadmin, a MYSQL web administration tool. This flaw may allow an unauthenticated attacker to brute-force MYSQL passwords, detect internal hostnames or opened ports on the internal network. Additionally there was a race condition between writing configuration and administrator moving it allowing unauthenticated users to read or alter it. Debian users who configured phpmyadmin via debconf and used the default configuration for Apache 2 or Lighttpd were never affected.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 4:3.4.11.1-2+deb7u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.
