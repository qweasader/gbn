CVE-2018-1304

The URL pattern of '' (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorized users to gain access to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.

CVE-2018-1305

Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not authorized to access them.

For Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version 8.0.14-1+deb8u12.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.
