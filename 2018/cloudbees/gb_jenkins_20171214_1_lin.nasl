This resulted in the following security settings not being set to their usual strict default:

  - No security realm was defined, and no admin user was created whose password was written to the Jenkins log or the initialPassword file.

  - The authorization strategy remained Anyone can do anything rather than Logged-in users can do anything.

  - TCP port for JNLP agents, usually disabled by default, was open, unless a Java system property controlling it was set.

  - CLI over Remoting was enabled.

  - CSRF Protection was disabled.
