  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007
driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2017-17975)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation
in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18193)

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS
Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2017-18222)

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
validate that rules containing jumps contained user-defined chains. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-1065)

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not
properly validate ebtables offsets. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2018-1068)

It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in
the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1130)

It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some
situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2018-5803)

It was discovered that a double free error existed in the block layer
subsystem of the Linux kernel when setting up a request queue. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7480)

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of
the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-7757)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 machine check
handler in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2018-7995)

Eyal Itkin discovered that the USB displaylink video adapter driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate mmap offsets sent from userspace. A
local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel
memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8781)

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS
implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a
malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8822)");
