  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-0038

'Solar Designer' discovered that arithmetic computations in netfilter's do_replace() function can lead to a buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary code. However, the operation requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges, which is only an issue in virtualization systems or fine grained access control systems.

CVE-2006-0039

'Solar Designer' discovered a race condition in netfilter's do_add_counters() function, which allows information disclosure of kernel memory by exploiting a race condition. Like CVE-2006-0038, it requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges.

CVE-2006-0741

Intel EM64T systems were discovered to be susceptible to a local DoS due to an endless recursive fault related to a bad ELF entry address.

CVE-2006-0742

Incorrectly declared die_if_kernel() function as 'does never return' which could be exploited by a local attacker resulting in a kernel crash.

CVE-2006-1056

AMD64 machines (and other 7th and 8th generation AuthenticAMD processors) were found to be vulnerable to sensitive information leakage, due to how they handle saving and restoring the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an exception is pending. This allows a process to determine portions of the state of floating point instructions of other processes.

CVE-2006-1242

Marco Ivaldi discovered that there was an unintended information disclosure allowing remote attackers to bypass protections against Idle Scans (nmap -sI) by abusing the ID field of IP packets and bypassing the zero IP ID in DF packet countermeasure. This was a result of the ip_push_pending_frames function improperly incremented the IP ID field when sending a RST after receiving unsolicited TCP SYN-ACK packets.

CVE-2006-1343

Pavel Kankovsky reported the existence of a potential information leak resulting from the failure to initialize sin.sin_zero in the IPv4 socket code.

CVE-2006-1368

Shaun Tancheff discovered a buffer overflow (boundary condition error) in the USB Gadget RNDIS implementation allowing remote attackers to cause a DoS. While creating a reply message, the driver allocated memory for the reply data, but not for the reply structure. The kernel fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer. Attackers could crash the system, or possibly execute arbitrary machine code.

CVE-2006-1524

Hugh Dickins discovered an issue in the madvise_remove() function wherein file and mmap restrictions are not followed, allowing local users to bypass IPC permissions and replace portions of readonly tmpfs files with zeroes.

CVE-2006-1525

Alexandra Kossovsky reported a NULL pointer dereference condition in ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
