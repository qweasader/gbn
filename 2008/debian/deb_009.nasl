Universal SSL tunnel for other network daemons). Brian Hatch
responded by stating he was already preparing a new release with
multiple security fixes:

1. the PRNG (pseudo-random generated) was not seeded correctly.
This only affects operation on operating systems without a
secure random generator (like Linux)
2. Pid files were not created securely, making stunnel vulnerable
to a symlink attack
3. There was an insecure syslog() call which could be exploited if
the user could manage to insert text into the logged text. At
least one way to exploit this using faked identd responses was
demonstrated by Lez.

These problems have been fixed in version 3.10-0potato1.");
