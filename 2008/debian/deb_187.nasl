  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"According to David Wagner, iDEFENSE and the Apache HTTP Server
Project, several remotely exploitable vulnerabilities have been found
in the Apache package, a commonly used webserver.  These
vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to enact a denial of service
against a server or execute a cross scripting attack.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project identified the following
vulnerabilities:

1. CVE-2002-0839: A vulnerability exists on platforms using System V
shared memory based scoreboards.  This vulnerability allows an
attacker who can execute under the Apache UID to exploit the Apache
shared memory scoreboard format and send a signal to any process as
root or cause a local denial of service attack.

2. CVE-2002-0840: Apache is susceptible to a cross site scripting
vulnerability in the default 404 page of any web server hosted on a
domain that allows wildcard DNS lookups.

3. CVE-2002-0843: There were some possible overflows in the utility
ApacheBench (ab) which could be exploited by a malicious server.

4. CVE-2002-1233: A race condition in the htpasswd and htdigest
program enables a malicious local user to read or even modify the
contents of a password file or easily create and overwrite files as
the user running the htpasswd (or htdigest respectively) program.

5. CVE-2001-0131: htpasswd and htdigest in Apache 2.0a9, 1.3.14, and
others allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a
symlink attack.

This is the same vulnerability as CVE-2002-1233, which was fixed in
potato already but got lost later and was never applied upstream.

5. NO-CAN: Several buffer overflows have been found in the ApacheBench
(ab) utility that could be exploited by a remote server returning
very long strings.

These problems have been fixed in version 1.3.26-0woody3 for the
current stable distribution (woody) and in 1.3.9-14.3 for the old
stable distribution (potato).  Corrected packages for the unstable
distribution (sid) are expected soon.");
