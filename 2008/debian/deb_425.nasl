CVE-2003-1029 - infinite loop and memory consumption in processing
L2TP packets

CVE-2003-0989, CVE-2004-0057 - infinite loops in processing ISAKMP
packets.

CVE-2004-0055 - segmentation fault caused by a RADIUS attribute with a
large length value

For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 3.6.2-2.7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.
