The problem is part of most's tab expansion where the program would
write beyond the bounds two array variables when viewing a malicious
file.  This could lead into other data structures being overwritten
which in turn could enable most to execute arbitrary code being able
to compromise the users environment.

This has been fixed in the upstream version 4.9.2 and an updated
version of 4.9.0 for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.");
