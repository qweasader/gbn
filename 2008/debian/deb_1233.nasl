CVE-2006-3741

Stephane Eranian discovered a local DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability on the ia64 architecture. A local user could exhaust the available file descriptors by exploiting a counting error in the permonctl() system call.

CVE-2006-4538

Kirill Korotaev reported a local DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability on the ia64 and sparc architectures. A user could cause the system to crash by executing a malformed ELF binary due to insufficient verification of the memory layout.

CVE-2006-4813

Dmitriy Monakhov reported a potential memory leak in the __block_prepare_write function. __block_prepare_write does not properly sanitize kernel buffers during error recovery, which could be exploited by local users to gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2006-4997

ADLab Venustech Info Ltd reported a potential remote DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability in the IP over ATM subsystem. A remote system could cause the system to crash by sending specially crafted packets that would trigger an attempt to free an already-freed pointer resulting in a system crash.

CVE-2006-5174

Martin Schwidefsky reported a potential leak of sensitive information on s390 systems. The copy_from_user function did not clear the remaining bytes of the kernel buffer after receiving a fault on the userspace address, resulting in a leak of uninitialized kernel memory. A local user could exploit this by appending to a file from a bad address.

CVE-2006-5619

James Morris reported a potential local DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability that could be used to hang or oops a system. The seqfile handling for /proc/net/ip6_flowlabel has a flaw that can be exploited to cause an infinite loop by reading this file after creating a flowlabel.

CVE-2006-5649

Fabio Massimo Di Nitto reported a potential remote DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability on powerpc systems. The alignment exception only checked the exception table for -EFAULT, not for other errors. This can be exploited by a local user to cause a system crash (panic).

CVE-2006-5751

Eugene Teo reported a vulnerability in the get_fdb_entries function that could potentially be exploited to allow arbitrary code execution with escalated privileges.

CVE-2006-5871

Bill Allombert reported that various mount options are ignored by smbfs when UNIX extensions are enabled. This includes the uid, gid and mode options. Client systems would silently use the server-provided settings instead of honoring these options, changing the security model. This update includes a fix from Haroldo Gamal that forces the kernel to honor these mount options. Note that, since the current versions of smbmount always pass values for these ...
