  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2004-1017

Multiple overflows exist in the io_edgeport driver which might be usable as a denial of service attack vector.

CVE-2005-0124

Bryan Fulton reported a bounds checking bug in the coda_pioctl function which may allow local users to execute arbitrary code or trigger a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-0449

An error in the skb_checksum_help() function from the netfilter framework has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2457

Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the zisofs driver for compressed ISO file systems allows a denial of service attack through maliciously crafted ISO images.

CVE-2005-2490

A buffer overflow in the sendmsg() function allows local users to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2005-2555

Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to users/processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2709

Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices. A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.

CVE-2005-2800

Jan Blunck discovered that repeated failed reads of /proc/scsi/sg/devices leak memory, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2973

Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp_v6_get_port() function from the IPv6 code can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3044

Vasiliy Averin discovered that the reference counters from sockfd_put() and fput() can be forced into overlapping, which allows a denial of service attack through a null pointer dereference.

CVE-2005-3053

Eric Dumazet discovered that the set_mempolicy() system call accepts a negative value for its first argument, which triggers a BUG() assert. This allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3055

Harald Welte discovered that if a process issues a USB Request Block (URB) to a device and terminates before the URB completes, a stale pointer would be dereferenced. This could be used to trigger a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3180

Pavel Roskin discovered that the driver for Orinoco wireless cards clears its buffers insufficiently. This could leak sensitive information into user space.

CVE-2005-3181

Robert Derr discovered that the audit subsystem uses an incorrect function to free memory, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3257

Rudolf Polzer discovered that the kernel improperly restricts access to the KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
