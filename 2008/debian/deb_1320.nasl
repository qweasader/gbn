CVE-2007-2650

It was discovered that the OLE2 parser can be tricked into an infinite loop and memory exhaustion.

CVE-2007-3023

It was discovered that the NsPack decompression code performed insufficient sanitising on an internal length variable, resulting in a potential buffer overflow.

CVE-2007-3024

It was discovered that temporary files were created with insecure permissions, resulting in information disclosure.

CVE-2007-3122

It was discovered that the decompression code for RAR archives allows bypassing a scan of a RAR archive due to insufficient validity checks.

CVE-2007-3123

It was discovered that the decompression code for RAR archives performs insufficient validation of header values, resulting in a buffer overflow.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in version 0.84-2.sarge.17. Please note that the fix for CVE-2007-3024 hasn't been backported to oldstable.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version 0.90.1-3etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version 0.90.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages. An updated package for oldstable/powerpc is not yet available. It will be provided later.");
