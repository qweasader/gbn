files.  No checks were made to ensure that nobody placed a symlink
with the same name in /tmp in the meantime and thus was vulnerable to
a symlink attack.  This could lead to a malicious local user being
able to overwrite any file writable by the user executing exmh.
Upstream developers have reported and fixed this.  The exmh program
now use /tmp/login now unless TMPDIR or EXMHTMPDIR is set.

We recommend you upgrade your exmh packages immediately.");
