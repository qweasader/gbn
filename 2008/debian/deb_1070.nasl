CVE-2005-0124

Bryan Fulton reported a bounds checking bug in the coda_pioctl function which may allow local users to execute arbitrary code or trigger a denial of service attack.

CVE-2003-0984

Improper initialization of the RTC may disclose information.

CVE-2004-1070

Insufficient input sanitising in the load_elf_binary() function may lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2004-1071

Incorrect error handling in the binfmt_elf loader may lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2004-1072

A buffer overflow in the binfmt_elf loader may lead to privilege escalation or denial of service.

CVE-2004-1073

The open_exec function may disclose information.

CVE-2004-1074

The binfmt code is vulnerable to denial of service through malformed a.out binaries.

CVE-2004-0138

A denial of service vulnerability in the ELF loader has been found.
