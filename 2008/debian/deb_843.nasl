CAN-2005-2945

Eric Romang discovered that the ARC archive program under Unix creates a temporary file with insecure permissions which may lead to an attacker stealing sensitive information.

CAN-2005-2992

Joey Schulze discovered that the temporary file was created in an insecure fashion as well, leaving it open to a classic symlink attack.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain arc packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in version 5.21l-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version 5.21m-1.
