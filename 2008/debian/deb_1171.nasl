CVE-2006-4333

It was discovered that the Q.2391 dissector is vulnerable to denial of service caused by memory exhaustion.

CVE-2005-3241

It was discovered that the FC-FCS, RSVP and ISIS-LSP dissectors are vulnerable to denial of service caused by memory exhaustion.

CVE-2005-3242

It was discovered that the IrDA and SMB dissectors are vulnerable to denial of service caused by memory corruption.

CVE-2005-3243

It was discovered that the SLIMP3 and AgentX dissectors are vulnerable to code injection caused by buffer overflows.

CVE-2005-3244

It was discovered that the BER dissector is vulnerable to denial of service caused by an infinite loop.

CVE-2005-3246

It was discovered that the NCP and RTnet dissectors are vulnerable to denial of service caused by a null pointer dereference.

CVE-2005-3248

It was discovered that the X11 dissector is vulnerable to denial of service caused by a division through zero.

This update also fixes a 64 bit-specific regression in the ASN.1 decoder, which was introduced in a previous DSA.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in version 0.10.10-2sarge8.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.2-5.1 of wireshark, the network sniffer formerly known as ethereal.

We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.");
