in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 has several security problems:

the server would crash

  * by escaping dots as %2E it was possible to circumvent security measures
and download arbitrary files

gain root access

These have been fixed in version 1.3.10-1, and we strongly recommend
that you upgrade your icecast-server package immediately.");
