Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2004-0887

Martin Schwidefsky discovered that the privileged instruction SACF (Set Address Space Control Fast) on the S/390 platform is not handled properly, allowing for a local user to gain root privileges.

CVE-2004-1058

A race condition allows for a local user to read the environment variables of another process that is still spawning through /proc/.../cmdline.

CVE-2004-2607

A numeric casting discrepancy in sdla_xfer allows local users to read portions of kernel memory via a large len argument which is received as an int but cast to a short, preventing read loop from filling a buffer.

CVE-2005-0449

An error in the skb_checksum_help() function from the netfilter framework has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-1761

A vulnerability in the ptrace subsystem of the IA-64 architecture can allow local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.

CVE-2005-2457

Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the compressed ISO file system (zisofs) allows a denial of service attack through maliciously crafted ISO images.

CVE-2005-2555

Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to users/processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2709

Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices. A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.

CVE-2005-2973

Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp_v6_get_port() function from the IPv6 code can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3257

Rudolf Polzer discovered that the kernel improperly restricts access to the KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2005-3783

The ptrace code using CLONE_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3806

Yen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable, which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.

CVE-2005-3848

Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp_push_reply() function, which allows denial of service through memory consumption.

CVE-2005-3857
