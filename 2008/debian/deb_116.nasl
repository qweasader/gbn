encryption services into the Unix(tm) file system.  We are not yet
sure if these overflows can successfully be exploited to gain root
access to the machine running the CFS daemon.  However, since cfsd can
easily be forced to die, a malicious user can easily perform a denial
of service attack to it.

This problem has been fixed in version 1.3.3-8.1 for the stable Debian
distribution and in version 1.4.1-5 for the testing and undtable
distribution of Debian.");
