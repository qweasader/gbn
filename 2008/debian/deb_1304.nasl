Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

This update also fixes a regression in the smbfs subsystem which was introduced in DSA-1233 which caused symlinks to be interpreted as regular files.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-4811

David Gibson reported an issue in the hugepage code which could permit a local DoS (system crash) on appropriately configured systems.

CVE-2006-4814

Doug Chapman discovered a potential local DoS (deadlock) in the mincore function caused by improper lock handling.

CVE-2006-4623

Ang Way Chuang reported a remote DoS (crash) in the dvb driver which can be triggered by a ULE package with an SNDU length of 0.

CVE-2006-5753

Eric Sandeen provided a fix for a local memory corruption vulnerability resulting from a misinterpretation of return values when operating on inodes which have been marked bad.

CVE-2006-5754

Darrick Wong discovered a local DoS (crash) vulnerability resulting from the incorrect initialization of nr_pages in aio_setup_ring().

CVE-2006-5757

LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted iso9660 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6053

LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext3 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6056

LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted hfs filesystem on systems with SELinux hooks enabled (Debian does not enable SELinux by default).

CVE-2006-6060

LMH reported a potential local DoS (infinite loop) which could be exploited by a malicious user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted NTFS filesystem.

CVE-2006-6106

Marcel Holtman discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Bluetooth subsystem which can be used to trigger a remote DoS (crash) and potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-6535

Kostantin Khorenko discovered an invalid error path in dev_queue_xmit() which could be exploited by a local user to cause data corruption.

CVE-2007-0958

Santosh Eraniose reported a vulnerability that allows local users to read otherwise unreadable files by triggering a core dump while using PT_INTERP. This is related to CVE-2004-1073.

CVE-2007-1357

Jean Delvare reported a vulnerability in the appletalk subsystem. Systems with the appletalk module loaded can be triggered to crash by other systems on the local network via a malformed frame.

CVE-2007-1592

Masayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect can be exploited by ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
