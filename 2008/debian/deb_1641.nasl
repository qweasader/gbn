CVE-2008-4096

Remote authenticated users could execute arbitrary code on the host running phpMyAdmin through manipulation of a script parameter.

CVE-2008-3457

Cross site scripting through the setup script was possible in rare circumstances.

CVE-2008-3456

Protection has been added against remote websites loading phpMyAdmin into a frameset.

CVE-2008-3197

Cross site request forgery allowed remote attackers to create a new database, but not perform any other action on it.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version 4:2.9.1.1-8.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4:2.11.8.1-2.
