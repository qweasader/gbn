  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Sebastian Krahmer discovered that Postfix, a mail transfer agent, incorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox. In some configurations, this allows for appending data to arbitrary files as root.

Note that only specific configurations are vulnerable, the default Debian installation is not affected. Only a configuration meeting the following requirements is vulnerable:

The mail delivery style is mailbox, with the Postfix built-in local(8) or virtual(8) delivery agents.

The mail spool directory (/var/spool/mail) is user-writeable.

The user can create hardlinks pointing to root-owned symlinks located in other directories.

For a detailed treating of the issue, please refer to the upstream author's announcement.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version 2.3.8-2+etch1.

For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version 2.5.2-2lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.5.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postfix package.");
