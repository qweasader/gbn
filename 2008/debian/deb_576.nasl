CVE-1999-0710

It is possible to bypass access lists and scan arbitrary hosts and ports in the network through cachemgr.cgi, which is installed by default. This update disables this feature and introduces a configuration file (/etc/squid/cachemgr.conf) to control this behavior.

CAN-2004-0918

The asn_parse_header function (asn1.c) in the SNMP module for Squid allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via certain SNMP packets with negative length fields that causes a memory allocation error.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in version 2.4.6-2woody4.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version 2.5.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid package.");
