CVE-2005-4744
Off-by-one error in the sql_error function in sql_unixodbc.c in
FreeRADIUS 1.0.2.5-5, and possibly other versions including 1.0.4,
might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code by causing the external database query
to fail.  NOTE: this single issue is part of a larger-scale
disclosure, originally by SUSE, which reported multiple issues that
were disputed by FreeRADIUS.  Disputed issues included file descriptor
leaks, memory disclosure, LDAP injection, and other issues.  Without
additional information, the most recent FreeRADIUS report is being
regarded as the authoritative source for this CVE identifier.");
