  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"OpenSSH is a free version of the SSH protocol suite of network
connectivity tools.  OpenSSH encrypts all traffic (including
passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection
hijacking, and other network-level attacks.  Additionally, OpenSSH
provides a myriad of secure tunneling capabilities, as well as a
variety of authentication methods.

The SSH protocol exists in two versions, hereafter named simply `ssh1'
and `ssh2'.  The ssh1 protocol is a legacy protocol for which there
exists no formal specification, while the ssh2 protocol is the product
of the IETF SECSH working group and is defined by a series of IETF
draft standards.

The ssh2 protocol supports a wide range of authentication
mechanisms, including a generic challenge / response mechanism, called
`keyboard-interactive' or `kbdint', which can be adapted to serve any
authentication scheme in which the server and client exchange a
arbitrarily long series of challenges and responses.  In particular,
this mechanism is used in OpenSSH to support PAM authentication.

The ssh1 protocol, on the other hand, supports a much narrower range
of authentication mechanisms.  Its challenge / response mechanisms,
called `TIS', allows for only one challenge from the server and one
response from the client.  OpenSSH contains interface code which
allows kbdint authentication back-ends to be used for ssh1 TIS
authentication, provided they only emit one challenge and expect only
one response.

Finally, recent versions of OpenSSH implement a mechanism called
`privilege separation' in which the task of communicating with the
client is delegated to an unprivileged child process, while the
privileged parent process performs the actual authentication and
double-checks every important decision taken by its unprivileged
child.

1) Insufficient checking in the ssh1 challenge / response interface
   code, combined with a peculiarity of the PAM kbdint back-end,
   causes OpenSSH to ignore a negative result from PAM (but not from
   any other kbdint back-end).

2) A variable used by the PAM conversation function to store
   challenges and the associated client responses is incorrectly
   interpreted as an array of pointers to structures instead of a
   pointer to an array of structures.

3) When challenge / response authentication is used with protocol
   version 1, and a legitimate user interrupts challenge / response
   authentication but successfully authenticates through some other
   mechanism (such as password authentication), the server fails to
   reclaim resources allocated by the challenge / response mechanism,
   including the child process used for PAM authentication.  When a
   certain number of leaked processes is reached, the master server
   process will refuse subsequent client connections.");
