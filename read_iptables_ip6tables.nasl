Ip6tables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv6 packet filter rules in the
Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in
chains and may also contain user-defined chains.

Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with
a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the
same table.
