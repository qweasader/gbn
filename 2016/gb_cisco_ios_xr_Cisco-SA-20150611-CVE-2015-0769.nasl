  Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to trigger an ASIC scan of the Network Processor Unit (NPU) and a reload of the
  line card processing an IPv6 packet.");

  packet carrying IPv6 extension headers that are valid but unlikely to be seen during normal
  operation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending such an IPv6 packet to an
  affected device that is configured to process IPv6 traffic.

  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need to acquire additional information about the
  targeted device, such as whether the device has specific line cards installed and configured to
  process IPv6 traffic in addition to running an affected release of Cisco IOS XR Software. An
  attacker cannot exploit this vulnerability if these conditions are not met.");
