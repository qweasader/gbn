CVE-2014-9911

Michele Spagnuolo discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.

CVE-2015-2632

An integer overflow vulnerability might lead into a denial of service or disclosure of portion of application memory if an attacker has control on the input file.

CVE-2015-4844

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities might allow an attacker with control on the font file to perform a denial of service or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2016-0494

Integer signedness issues were introduced as part of the CVE-2015-4844 fix.

CVE-2016-6293

A buffer overflow might allow an attacker to perform a denial of service or disclosure of portion of application memory.

CVE-2016-7415

A stack-based buffer overflow might allow an attacker with control on the locale string to perform a denial of service and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in version 52.1-8+deb8u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 57.1-5.
