  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in GraphicsMagick, a collection of image processing tool, which can cause denial of service attacks, remote file deletion, and remote command execution.

This security update removes the full support of PLT/Gnuplot decoder to prevent Gnuplot-shell based shell exploits for fixing the CVE-2016-3714 vulnerability.

The undocumented TMP magick prefix no longer removes the argument file after it has been read for fixing the CVE-2016-3715 vulnerability. Since the TMP feature was originally implemented, GraphicsMagick added a temporary file management subsystem which assures that temporary files are removed so this feature is not needed.

Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or writing output to a shell command, by prefixing the specified filename (containing the command) with a '<pipe>' for fixing the CVE-2016-5118 vulnerability.

CVE-2015-8808

Gustavo Grieco discovered an out of bound read in the parsing of GIF files which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2317

Gustavo Grieco discovered a stack buffer overflow and two heap buffer overflows while processing SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2318

Gustavo Grieco discovered several segmentation faults while processing SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-5240

Gustavo Grieco discovered an endless loop problem caused by negative stroke-dasharray arguments while parsing SVG files which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-7800

Marco Grassi discovered an unsigned underflow leading to heap overflow when parsing 8BIM chunk often attached to JPG files which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-7996

Moshe Kaplan discovered that there is no check that the provided colormap is not larger than 256 entries in the WPG reader which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-7997

Moshe Kaplan discovered that an assertion is thrown for some files in the WPG reader due to a logic error which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8682

Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a stack buffer read overflow while reading the SCT header which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8683

Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the PCX coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8684

Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the SGI coder which may cause denial of service.

Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in MagickRealloc() function which may cause denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in version 1.3.20-3+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems (with the exception of CVE-2016-9830) have been fixed in version 1.3.25-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.3.25-6.
