  - HTTPS is used without certificate verification.

  - Under the '/cgi-bin/nobody' folder every CGI script can be accessed
    without authentication.

  - The web interface does not use any CSRF protection.

  - Every user password is stored in clear text.

  - The cgi_query action in Search.cgi performs HTML requests with the wget
    system command, which uses the received parameters without sanitization
    or verification.

  - The captcha verification is bypassed if the login requests contain the
    login=quick parameter.

  - No verification or white list-based checking of the parameter of the
    DoShellCmd function in ActionD daemon in 'adcommand.cgi' script.

  - The video player plugins are stored as .cab files in the web root, which can
    be accessed and downloaded without authentication.

  - The web server sends the file without processing it when a cab file is
    requested.

  - The devices that support the Avtech cloud contain CloudSetup.cgi, which can
    be accessed after authentication.");
