A remote attacker could use a spoofed packet that, when processed by an ntpd client, would cause that client to reject all future legitimate server responses, effectively disabling time synchronization on that client. (CVE-2016-1548)

An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain packets. An authenticated attacker could use a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode of 7 and larger, which could potentially (although highly unlikely) cause ntpd to crash. (CVE-2016-2518)

A flaw was found in the way libntp performed message authentication. An attacker able to observe the timing of the comparison function used in packet authentication could potentially use this flaw to recover the message digest. (CVE-2016-1550)
