A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's keyring handling code, where in key_reject_and_link() an uninitialised variable would eventually lead to arbitrary free address which could allow attacker to use a use-after-free style attack. (CVE-2016-4470)

A leak of information was possible when issuing a netlink command of the stack memory area leading up to this function call. An attacker could use this to determine stack information for use in a later exploit. (CVE-2016-5243)

A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in function rds_inc_info_copy of file net/rds/recv.c. The last field 'flags' of object 'minfo' is not initialized. This can leak data previously at the flags location to userspace. (CVE-2016-5244)

A flaw was found in the implementation of the Linux kernel's handling of networking challenge ack where an attacker is able to determine the shared counter which could be used to determine sequence numbers for TCP stream injection. (CVE-2016-5696)

(Updated on 2016-08-17: CVE-2016-5696 was fixed in this release but was not previously part of this errata)");
