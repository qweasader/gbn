  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was discovered in processing setsockopt for 32 bit processes on 64 bit systems. This flaw will allow attackers to alter arbitrary kernel memory when unloading a kernel module. This action is usually restricted to root-priveledged users but can also be leveraged if the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_NET_NS. (CVE-2016-4997)

An out-of-bounds heap memory access leading to a Denial of Service, heap disclosure, or further impact was found in setsockopt(). The function call is normally restricted to root, however some processes with cap_sys_admin may also be able to trigger this flaw in privileged container environments. (CVE-2016-4998)

A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. The pointer to the netlink socket attribute is not checked, which could cause a null pointer dereference when parsing the nested attributes in function tipc_nl_publ_dump().
This allows local users to cause a DoS. (CVE-2016-4951)

A double free vulnerability was found in netlink_dump, which could cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact. (CVE-2016-9806)

(Updated on 2016-07-14: CVE-2016-4998 and CVE-2016-4951 were fixed in this version, but was not previously listed in this errata.)
