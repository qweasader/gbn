cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2016-5289, CVE-2016-5290)

A same-origin policy bypass was discovered with local HTML files in some
circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2016-5291)

A crash was discovered when parsing URLs in some circumstances. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5292)

A heap buffer-overflow was discovered in Cairo when processing SVG
content. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,
an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5296)

An error was discovered in argument length checking in Javascript. If a
user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5297)

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash. (CVE-2016-9063)

It was discovered that addon updates failed to verify that the addon ID

An attacker that could perform a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack could
potentially exploit this to provide malicious addon updates.

A buffer overflow was discovered in nsScriptLoadHandler. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9066)

2 use-after-free bugs were discovered during DOM operations in some
circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
