Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()
handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a
recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-1583)

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB
over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially
sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-4004)

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB
device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker
with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2016-2187)

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the
MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly
validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3136)

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the
Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate
USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3137)

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the
Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not
properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3140)

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would
improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86
processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were
disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an
existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. (CVE-2016-3672)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger
Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An
attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2016-3689)

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver
in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error
occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3951)
