A use-after-free was discovered in the WebCrypto implementation in Blink.
If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an
attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via
application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5142)

It was discovered that the devtools subsystem in Blink mishandles various
parameters. An attacker could exploit this to bypass intended access
restrictions. (CVE-2016-5143, CVE-2016-5144)

It was discovered that Blink does not ensure that a taint property is
preserved after a structure-clone operation on an ImageBitmap object
derived from a cross-origin image. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-5145)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial
