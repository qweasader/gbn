Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the
device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2015-7515)

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel's AIO interface allowed single
writes greater than 2GB, which could cause an integer overflow when writing
to certain filesystems, socket or device types. A local attacker could this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2015-8830)

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not
take into account the mmap_min_addr value. A local attacker could use this
to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting
to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2016-0821)

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical
access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker
with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2016-2185)

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with
physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker
with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2016-2188)

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the
USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not
validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3138)

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not
perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a
guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in
the host OS. (CVE-2016-3156)

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-
switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use
this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or
obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-3157)");
