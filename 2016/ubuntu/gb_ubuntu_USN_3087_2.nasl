Original advisory details:

 Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the OCSP Status Request
 extension. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory
 consumption, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6304)

 Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when
 performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this
 issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This
 issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update.
 (CVE-2016-2177)

 Cesar Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL
 did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing.
 A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing
 attack and recover private DSA keys. (CVE-2016-2178)

 Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime
 of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could
 possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of
 service. (CVE-2016-2179)

 Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the
 TS_OBJ_print_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this
 issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2180)

 It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay
 feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial
 of service. (CVE-2016-2181)

 Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A
 remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
 (CVE-2016-2182)

 Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES
 ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could
 possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted
 sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM.
 (CVE-2016-2183)

 Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths.
 A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service.
 (CVE-2016-6302)

 Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the
 MDC2_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
 cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6303)

 Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message
 length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a
 denial of service. (CVE-2016-6306)");
