implementation in Imlib2. An attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (application crash) or possibly obtain sensitive

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered an off-by-one error when handling
coordinates in Imlib2. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (application crash). (CVE-2016-3993)

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that integer overflows existed in Imlib2
when handling images with large dimensions. An attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion or application
crash). (CVE-2014-9771, CVE-2016-4024)

Kevin Ryde discovered that the ellipse drawing code in Imlib2 would
attempt to divide by zero when drawing a 2x1 ellipse. An attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handled GIF images
without colormaps. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-9762)

It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handle some PNM images,
leading to a division by zero. An attacker could use this to cause
a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-9763)

It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handle error conditions
