  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"389 Directory Server is an LDAP version 3
(LDAPv3) compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server administration.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version:
389-ds-base (1.3.5.10). (BZ#1270020)

Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that 389 Directory Server was vulnerable to a flaw in which
the default ACI (Access Control Instructions) could be read by an anonymous
user. This could lead to leakage of sensitive information. (CVE-2016-5416)

  * An information disclosure flaw was found in 389 Directory Server. A user
with no access to objects in certain LDAP sub-tree could send LDAP ADD
operations with a specific object name. The error message returned to the
user was different based on whether the target object existed or not.
(CVE-2016-4992)

  * It was found that 389 Directory Server was vulnerable to a remote
password disclosure via timing attack. A remote attacker could possibly use
this flaw to retrieve directory server password after many tries.
(CVE-2016-5405)

The CVE-2016-5416 issue was discovered by Viktor Ashirov (Red Hat)  the
CVE-2016-4992 issue was discovered by Petr Spacek (Red Hat) and Martin
Basti (Red Hat)  and the CVE-2016-5405 issue was discovered by William
Brown (Red Hat).
