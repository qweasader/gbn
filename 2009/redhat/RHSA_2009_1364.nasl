The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) is a configurable re-implementation of XDM,
the X Display Manager. GDM allows you to log in to your system with the X
Window System running, and supports running several different X sessions on
your local machine at the same time.

A flaw was found in the way the gdm package was built. The gdm package was
missing TCP wrappers support, which could result in an administrator
believing they had access restrictions enabled when they did not.
(CVE-2009-2697)

All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these
issues. GDM must be restarted for this update to take effect. Rebooting
achieves this, but changing the runlevel from 5 to 3 and back to 5 also
restarts GDM.");
