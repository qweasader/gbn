A server-side code injection flaw was found in the SquirrelMail
map_yp_alias function. If SquirrelMail was configured to retrieve a
user's IMAP server address from a Network Information Service (NIS) server
via the map_yp_alias function, an unauthenticated, remote attacker using
a specially-crafted username could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the web server. (CVE-2009-1579)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. An
attacker could construct a carefully crafted URL, which once visited by an
unsuspecting user, could cause the user's web browser to execute malicious
script in the context of the visited SquirrelMail web page. (CVE-2009-1578)

It was discovered that SquirrelMail did not properly sanitize Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) directives used in HTML mail. A remote attacker could
send a specially-crafted email that could place mail content above
SquirrelMail's controls, possibly allowing phishing and cross-site
scripting attacks. (CVE-2009-1581)

Users of squirrelmail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.");
