advisory RHSA-2009:1132.

These updated packages fix the following security issues:

  * a flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in the Linux
kernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across
multiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak
through a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that
would cause a denial of service. (CVE-2009-1385, Important)

  * the Linux kernel Network File System daemon (nfsd) implementation did not
drop the CAP_MKNOD capability when handling requests from local,
unprivileged users. This flaw could possibly lead to an information leak or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-1072, Moderate)

  * Frank Filz reported the NFSv4 client was missing a file permission check
for the execute bit in some situations. This could allow local,
unprivileged users to run non-executable files on NFSv4 mounted file
systems. (CVE-2009-1630, Moderate)

  * a missing check was found in the hypervisor_callback() function in the
Linux kernel provided by the kernel-xen package. This could cause a denial
of service of a 32-bit guest if an application running in that guest
accesses a certain memory location in the kernel. (CVE-2009-1758, Moderate)

  * a flaw was found in the AGPGART driver. The agp_generic_alloc_page() and
agp_generic_alloc_pages() functions did not zero out the memory pages they
allocate, which may later be available to user-space processes. This flaw
could possibly lead to an information leak. (CVE-2009-1192, Low)");
