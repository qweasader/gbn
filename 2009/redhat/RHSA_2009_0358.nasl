Evolution is the integrated collection of e-mail, calendaring, contact
management, communications, and personal information management (PIM) tools
for the GNOME desktop environment.

It was discovered that evolution did not properly validate NTLM (NT LAN
Manager) authentication challenge packets. A malicious server using NTLM
authentication could cause evolution to disclose portions of its memory or
crash during user authentication. (CVE-2009-0582)

An integer overflow flaw which could cause heap-based buffer overflow was
found in the Base64 encoding routine used by evolution. This could cause
evolution to crash, or, possibly, execute an arbitrary code when large
untrusted data blocks were Base64-encoded. (CVE-2009-0587)

All users of evolution are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
instances of evolution must be restarted for the update to take effect.");
