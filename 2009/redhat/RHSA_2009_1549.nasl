GNU Wget is a file retrieval utility that can use HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.

Daniel Stenberg reported that Wget is affected by the previously published
null prefix attack, caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in
X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could
use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse Wget into accepting it by mistake. (CVE-2009-3490)

Wget users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
backported patch to correct this issue.");
