libwmf is a library for reading and converting Windows Metafile Format
(WMF) vector graphics. libwmf is used by applications such as GIMP and
ImageMagick.

A pointer use-after-free flaw was found in the GD graphics library embedded
in libwmf. An attacker could create a specially-crafted WMF file that would
cause an application using libwmf to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code as the user running the application when opened by a victim.
(CVE-2009-1364)

Note: This flaw is specific to the GD graphics library embedded in libwmf.
It does not affect the GD graphics library from the gd packages, or
applications using it.

Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team for
responsibly reporting this flaw.

All users of libwmf are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
update, all applications using libwmf must be restarted for the update
to take effect.");
