Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2009-3979, CVE-2009-3981, CVE-2009-3986)

A flaw was found in the Firefox NT Lan Manager (NTLM) authentication
protocol implementation. If an attacker could trick a local user that has
NTLM credentials into visiting a specially-crafted web page, they could
send arbitrary requests, authenticated with the user's NTLM credentials, to
other applications on the user's system. (CVE-2009-3983)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the SSL location bar
indicator. An attacker could create an unencrypted web page that appears to
be encrypted, possibly tricking the user into believing they are visiting a
secure page. (CVE-2009-3984)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed blank pages after a user
navigates to an invalid address. If a user visits an attacker-controlled
web page that results in a blank page, the attacker could inject content
into that blank page, possibly tricking the user into believing they are
viewing a legitimate page. (CVE-2009-3985)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 3.0.16. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this errata.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.16, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.");
