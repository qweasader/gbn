advisory RHSA-2009:1438.

This update fixes the following security issues:

  * the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags were not cleared when a
setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

  * it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the clear_child_tid
pointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this pointer points to a
writable portion of the memory of the new program, the kernel could corrupt
four bytes of memory, possibly leading to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848, Important)

  * Solar Designer reported a missing capability check in the z90crypt driver
in the Linux kernel. This missing check could allow a local user with an
effective user ID (euid) of 0 to bypass intended capability restrictions.
(CVE-2009-1883, Moderate)

  * a flaw was found in the way the do_sigaltstack() function in the Linux
kernel copies the stack_t structure to user-space. On 64-bit machines, this
flaw could lead to a four-byte information leak. (CVE-2009-2847, Moderate)");
