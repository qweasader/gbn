The imap package provides server daemons for both the IMAP (Internet
Message Access Protocol) and POP (Post Office Protocol) mail access protocols.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the dmail and tmail mail delivery
utilities shipped with imap. If either of these utilities were used as a
mail delivery agent, a remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to
run arbitrary code as the targeted user by sending a specially-crafted mail
message to the victim. (CVE-2008-5005)

Users of imap should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to resolve this issue.");
