SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

Form submissions in SquirrelMail did not implement protection against
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker tricked a
user into visiting a malicious web page, the attacker could hijack that
user's authentication, inject malicious content into that user's
preferences, or possibly send mail without that user's permission.
(CVE-2009-2964)

Users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to correct these issues.");
