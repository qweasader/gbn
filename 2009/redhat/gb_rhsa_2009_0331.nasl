advisory RHSA-2009:0331.

This update addresses the following security issues:

  * a buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel Partial Reliable Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (PR-SCTP) implementation. This could,
potentially, lead to a denial of service if a Forward-TSN chunk is received
with a large stream ID. (CVE-2009-0065, Important)

  * a memory leak was found in keyctl handling. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to deplete kernel memory, eventually leading to a
denial of service. (CVE-2009-0031, Important)

  * a deficiency was found in the Remote BIOS Update (RBU) driver for Dell
systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
service by reading zero bytes from the image_type or packet_size file in
/sys/devices/platform/dell_rbu/. (CVE-2009-0322, Important)

  * a deficiency was found in the libATA implementation. This could,
potentially, lead to a denial of service. Note: by default, /dev/sg*
devices are accessible only to the root user. (CVE-2008-5700, Low)

This update also fixes a number of non-security related bugs.
For details, please visit the referenced advisories.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users should upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues. The
system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.");
