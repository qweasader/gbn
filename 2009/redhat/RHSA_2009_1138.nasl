Openswan is a free implementation of Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
and Internet Key Exchange (IKE). IPsec uses strong cryptography to provide
both authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to
build secure tunnels through untrusted networks. Everything passing through
the untrusted network is encrypted by the IPsec gateway machine, and
decrypted by the gateway at the other end of the tunnel. The resulting
tunnel is a virtual private network (VPN).

Multiple insufficient input validation flaws were found in the way
Openswan's pluto IKE daemon processed some fields of X.509 certificates. A
remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted X.509 certificate that
would crash the pluto daemon. (CVE-2009-2185)

All users of openswan are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain a backported patch to correct these issues. After installing
this update, the ipsec service will be restarted automatically.");
