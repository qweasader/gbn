The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

Multiple security flaws were found in the way Flash Player displayed
certain SWF content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
specially-crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing
the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2009-1862, CVE-2009-1863,
CVE-2009-1864, CVE-2009-1865, CVE-2009-1866, CVE-2009-1868, CVE-2009-1869)

A clickjacking flaw was discovered in Flash Player. A specially-crafted
SWF file could trick a user into unintentionally or mistakenly clicking a
link or a dialog. (CVE-2009-1867)

A flaw was found in the Flash Player local sandbox. A specially-crafted
SWF file could cause information disclosure when it was saved to the hard
drive. (CVE-2009-1870)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 10.0.32.18.");
