The ipsec-tools package is used in conjunction with the IPsec functionality
in the Linux kernel and includes racoon, an IKEv1 keying daemon.

A denial of service flaw was found in the ipsec-tools racoon daemon. An
unauthenticated, remote attacker could trigger a NULL pointer dereference
that could cause the racoon daemon to crash. (CVE-2009-1574)

Multiple memory leak flaws were found in the ipsec-tools racoon daemon. If
a remote attacker is able to make multiple connection attempts to the
racoon daemon, it was possible to cause the racoon daemon to consume all
available memory. (CVE-2009-1632)

Users of ipsec-tools should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
backported patches to correct these issues. Users must restart the racoon
daemon for this update to take effect.");
