SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3072, CVE-2009-3075)

A use-after-free flaw was found in SeaMonkey. An attacker could use this
flaw to crash SeaMonkey or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3077)

Descriptions in the dialogs when adding and removing PKCS #11 modules were
not informative. An attacker able to trick a user into installing a
malicious PKCS #11 module could use this flaw to install their own
Certificate Authority certificates on a user's machine, making it possible
to trick the user into believing they are viewing a trusted site or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3076)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displays the address bar when
window.open() is called in a certain way. An attacker could use this flaw
to conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user into believing they
are viewing a trusted site. (CVE-2009-2654)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
the changes to take effect.");
