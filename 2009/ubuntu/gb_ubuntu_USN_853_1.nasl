  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Alin Rad Pop discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in Firefox when it
converted strings to floating point numbers. If a user were tricked into
viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service
or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the
program. (CVE-2009-1563)

Jeremy Brown discovered that the Firefox Download Manager was vulnerable to
symlink attacks. A local attacker could exploit this to create or overwrite
files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2009-3274)

Paul Stone discovered a flaw in the Firefox form history. If a user were
tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could access this
data to steal confidential information. (CVE-2009-3370)

Orlando Berrera discovered that Firefox did not properly free memory when using
web-workers. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote
attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 9.10. (CVE-2009-3371)

A flaw was discovered in the way Firefox processed Proxy Auto-configuration
(PAC) files. If a user configured the browser to use PAC files with certain
regular expressions, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
(CVE-2009-3372)

A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in Mozilla's GIF image parser. If a
user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could
cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2009-3373)

A flaw was discovered in the JavaScript engine of Firefox. An attacker could
exploit this to execute scripts from page content with chrome privileges.
(CVE-2009-3374)

Gregory Fleischer discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be
bypassed by utilizing the document.getSelection function. An attacker could
exploit this to read data from other domains. (CVE-2009-3375)

Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm discovered that Firefox did not properly display
filenames containing right-to-left (RTL) override characters. If a user were
tricked into downloading a malicious file with a crafted filename, an attacker
could exploit this to trick the user into opening a different file than the
user expected. (CVE-2009-3376)

Several flaws were discovered in third party media libraries. If a user were
tricked into opening a crafted media file, a remote attacker could cause a
denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10.
