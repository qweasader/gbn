Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that the wordwrap function did not correctly
 check lengths. Remote attackers could exploit this to cause
 a crash or monopolize CPU resources, resulting in a denial of
 service. (CVE-2007-3998)

 Integer overflows were discovered in the strspn and strcspn functions.
 Attackers could exploit this to read arbitrary areas of memory, possibly
 gaining access to sensitive information. (CVE-2007-4657)

 Stanislav Malyshev discovered that money_format function did not correctly
 handle certain tokens. If a PHP application were tricked into processing
 a bad format string, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with
 application privileges. (CVE-2007-4658)

 It was discovered that the php_openssl_make_REQ function did not
 correctly check buffer lengths. A remote attacker could send a
 specially crafted message and execute arbitrary code with application
 privileges. (CVE-2007-4662)

 It was discovered that certain characters in session cookies were not
 handled correctly. A remote attacker could injection values which could
 lead to altered application behavior, potentially gaining additional
 privileges. (CVE-2007-3799)

 Gerhard Wagner discovered that the chunk_split function did not
 correctly handle long strings. A remote attacker could exploit this
 to execute arbitrary code with application privileges. (CVE-2007-2872,
 CVE-2007-4660, CVE-2007-4661)

 Stefan Esser discovered that deeply nested arrays could be made to
 fill stack space. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a
 crash or monopolize CPU resources, resulting in a denial of service.
 (CVE-2007-1285, CVE-2007-4670)

 Rasmus Lerdorf discovered that the htmlentities and htmlspecialchars
 functions did not correctly stop when handling partial multibyte
 sequences. A remote attacker could exploit this to read certain areas of
 memory, possibly gaining access to sensitive information. (CVE-2007-5898)

 It was discovered that the output_add_rewrite_var function would
 sometimes leak session id information to forms targeting remote URLs.
 Malicious remote sites could use this information to gain access to a
 PHP application user's login credentials. (CVE-2007-5899)");
