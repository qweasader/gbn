Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be
bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. An attacker could exploit this to read data
from other domains. (CVE-2008-5503)

Marius Schilder discovered that Firefox did not properly handle redirects to
an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.
It's possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the
XMLHttpRequest response. (CVE-2008-5506)

Chris Evans discovered that Firefox did not properly protect a user's data when
accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable
Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious
website, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data.
(CVE-2008-5507)

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked
into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute
arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another website or with chrome
privileges. (CVE-2008-5511, CVE-2008-5512)");
