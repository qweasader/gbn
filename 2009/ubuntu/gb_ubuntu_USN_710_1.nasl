Ogg and Windows Media files. If a user or automated system were tricked into
opening a specially crafted Ogg or Windows Media file, an attacker could cause
xine-lib to crash, creating a denial of service. This issue only applied to
Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 7.10, and 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2008-3231)

It was discovered that the MNG, MOD, and Real demuxers in xine-lib did not
correctly handle memory allocation failures. If a user or automated system were
tricked into opening a specially crafted MNG, MOD, or Real file, an attacker
could crash xine-lib or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user invoking the program. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 7.10,
and 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2008-5233)

It was discovered that the QT demuxer in xine-lib did not correctly handle
an invalid metadata atom size, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. If a
user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MOV file,
an attacker could execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

It was discovered that the Real, RealAudio, and Matroska demuxers in xine-lib
did not correctly handle malformed files, resulting in heap-based buffer

code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2008-5236)

It was discovered that the MNG and QT demuxers in xine-lib did not correctly

It was discovered that the Matroska, MOD, Real, and Real Audio demuxers in
xine-lib did not correctly handle malformed files, resulting in integer

It was discovered that the input handlers in xine-lib did not correctly handle
certain error codes, resulting in out-of-bounds reads and heap-based buffer
overflows. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially
crafted file, stream, or URL, an attacker could execute arbitrary code as the
user invoking the program. (CVE-2008-5239)

It was discovered that the Matroska and Real demuxers in xine-lib did not
correctly handle memory allocation failures. If a user or automated system were
