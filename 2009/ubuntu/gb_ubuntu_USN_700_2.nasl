Original advisory details:

 Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not
 correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or
 automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file,
 a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. (CVE-2007-4829)

 Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly
 handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or
 automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression,
 a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial
 of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. (CVE-2008-1927)

 A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree
 function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call
 of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06
 and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. (CVE-2008-5302)

 A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree
 function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call of
 rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected
 by this issue. (CVE-2008-5303)");
