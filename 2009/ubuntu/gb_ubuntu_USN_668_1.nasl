check in Thunderbird could be bypassed. If a user were tricked into opening a
malicious website, an attacker could obtain private information from data
stored in the images, or discover information about software on the user's
computer. (CVE-2008-5012)

Jesse Ruderman discovered that Thunderbird did not properly guard locks on
non-native objects. If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into
opening malicious web content, an attacker could cause a browser crash and
possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2008-5014)

Several problems were discovered in the browser, layout and JavaScript engines.
If a user had JavaScript enabled, these problems could allow an attacker to
crash Thunderbird and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
(CVE-2008-5016, CVE-2008-5017, CVE-2008-5018)

A flaw was discovered in Thunderbird's DOM constructing code. If a user were
tricked into opening a malicious website while having JavaScript enabled, an
attacker could cause the browser to crash and potentially execute arbitrary
code with user privileges. (CVE-2008-5021)

It was discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be bypassed.
If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into opening malicious web
content, an attacker could execute JavaScript in the context of a different
website. (CVE-2008-5022)

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly parse E4X documents,
leading to quote characters in the namespace not being properly escaped.
(CVE-2008-5024)

Boris Zbarsky discovered that Thunderbird did not properly process comments in
forwarded in-line messages. If a user had JavaScript enabled and opened a
malicious email, an attacker may be able to obtain information about the
recipient.");
