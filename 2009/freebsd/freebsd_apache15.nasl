CVE-2009-1891
The mod_deflate module in Apache httpd 2.2.11 and earlier compresses
large files until completion even after the associated network
connection is closed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (CPU consumption).

CVE-2009-1195
The Apache HTTP Server 2.2.11 and earlier 2.2 versions does not
properly handle Options=IncludesNOEXEC in the AllowOverride directive,
which allows local users to gain privileges by configuring (1) Options
Includes, (2) Options +Includes, or (3) Options +IncludesNOEXEC in a
.htaccess file, and then inserting an exec element in a .shtml file.

CVE-2009-1890
The stream_reqbody_cl function in mod_proxy_http.c in the mod_proxy
module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.3.3, when a reverse proxy is
configured, does not properly handle an amount of streamed data that
exceeds the Content-Length value, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted requests.

CVE-2009-1191
mod_proxy_ajp.c in the mod_proxy_ajp module in the Apache HTTP Server
2.2.11 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive response data,
intended for a client that sent an earlier POST request with no
request body, via an HTTP request.

CVE-2009-0023
The apr_strmatch_precompile function in strmatch/apr_strmatch.c in
Apache APR-util before 1.3.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (daemon crash) via crafted input involving (1) a .htaccess
file used with the Apache HTTP Server, (2) the SVNMasterURI directive
in the mod_dav_svn module in the Apache HTTP Server, (3) the
mod_apreq2 module for the Apache HTTP Server, or (4) an application
that uses the libapreq2 library, which triggers a heap-based buffer
underflow.

CVE-2009-1955
The expat XML parser in the apr_xml_* interface in xml/apr_xml.c in
Apache APR-util before 1.3.7, as used in the mod_dav and mod_dav_svn
modules in the Apache HTTP Server, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted XML document
containing a large number of nested entity references, as demonstrated
by a PROPFIND request, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.

CVE-2009-1956
Off-by-one error in the apr_brigade_vprintf function in Apache
APR-util before 1.3.5 on big-endian platforms allows remote attackers
to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service
(application crash) via crafted input.");
