CVE-2009-0163
Integer overflow in the TIFF image decoding routines in CUPS 1.3.9 and
earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image,
which is not properly handled by the (1) _cupsImageReadTIFF function
in the imagetops filter and (2) imagetoraster filter, leading to a
heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2009-0164
The web interface for CUPS before 1.3.10 does not validate the HTTP
Host header in a client request, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to conduct DNS rebinding attacks.

CVE-2009-0146
Multiple buffer overflows in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and
earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, and other products allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file,
related to (1) JBIG2SymbolDict::setBitmap and (2)
JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg.

CVE-2009-0147
Multiple integer overflows in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and
earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, and other products allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file,
related to (1) JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg, (2)
JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg, and (3)
JBIG2Stream::readGenericBitmap.

CVE-2009-0166
The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
and other products allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) via a crafted PDF file that triggers a free of
uninitialized memory.");
