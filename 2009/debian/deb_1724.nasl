CVE-2009-0500

It was discovered that the information stored in the log tables was not properly sanitized, which could allow attackers to inject arbitrary web code.

CVE-2009-0502

It was discovered that certain input via the 'Login as' function was not properly sanitised leading to the injection of arbitrary web script.

CVE-2008-5153

Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the SpellCheker plugin creates temporary files insecurely, allowing a denial of service attack. Since the plugin was unused, it is removed in this update.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version 1.6.3-2+etch2.

For the testing (lenny) distribution these problems have been fixed in version 1.8.2.dfsg-3+lenny1.

For the unstable (sid) distribution these problems have been fixed in version 1.8.2.dfsg-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your moodle package.");
