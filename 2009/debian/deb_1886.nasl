CVE-2009-3079

'moz_bug_r_a4' discovered that a programming error in the FeedWriter module could lead to the execution of Javascript code with elevated privileges.

CVE-2009-1310

Prateek Saxena discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the MozSearch plugin interface.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 3.0.6-3.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle. You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.0.14-1.

For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in version 3.5.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.");
