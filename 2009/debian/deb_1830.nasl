CVE-2009-0040

The execution of arbitrary code might be possible via a crafted PNG file that triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer in (1) the png_read_png function, (2) pCAL chunk handling, or (3) setup of 16-bit gamma tables. (MFSA 2009-10)

CVE-2009-0352

It is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the layout engine. (MFSA 2009-01)

CVE-2009-0353

It is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the JavaScript engine. (MFSA 2009-01)

CVE-2009-0652

Bjoern Hoehrmann and Moxie Marlinspike discovered a possible spoofing attack via Unicode box drawing characters in internationalized domain names. (MFSA 2009-15)

CVE-2009-0771

Memory corruption and assertion failures have been discovered in the layout engine, leading to the possible execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2009-07)

CVE-2009-0772

The layout engine allows the execution of arbitrary code in vectors related to nsCSSStyleSheet::GetOwnerNode, events, and garbage collection. (MFSA 2009-07)

CVE-2009-0773

The JavaScript engine is prone to the execution of arbitrary code via several vectors. (MFSA 2009-07)

CVE-2009-0774

The layout engine allows the execution of arbitrary code via vectors related to gczeal. (MFSA 2009-07)

CVE-2009-0776

Georgi Guninski discovered that it is possible to obtain xml data via an issue related to the nsIRDFService. (MFSA 2009-09)

CVE-2009-1302

The browser engine is prone to a possible memory corruption via several vectors. (MFSA 2009-14)

CVE-2009-1303

The browser engine is prone to a possible memory corruption via the nsSVGElement::BindToTree function. (MFSA 2009-14)

CVE-2009-1307

Gregory Fleischer discovered that it is possible to bypass the Same Origin Policy when opening a Flash file via the view-source: scheme. (MFSA 2009-17)

CVE-2009-1832

The possible arbitrary execution of code was discovered via vectors involving 'double frame construction.' (MFSA 2009-24)

CVE-2009-1392

Several issues were discovered in the browser engine as used by icedove, which could lead to the possible execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2009-24)

CVE-2009-1836

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang and Ming Zhang reported a potential man-in-the-middle attack, when using a proxy due to insufficient checks on a certain proxy response. (MFSA 2009-27)

CVE-2009-1838

moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges due to an error in the garbage collection implementation. (MFSA 2009-29)

CVE-2009-1841

moz_bug_r_a4 reported that it is possible for scripts from page content to run with elevated privileges and thus potentially executing arbitrary code with the object's chrome privileges. (MFSA ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
