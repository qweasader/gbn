Integer signedness error in the store_id3_text function in the
ID3v2 code in mpg123 before 1.7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via an ID3 tag with a negative encoding value.  NOTE:
some of these details are obtained from third party information
(CVE-2009-1301).

The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.

Update:

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
Corporate products.
