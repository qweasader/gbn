Integer overflow in the ISC dhcpd 3.0.x before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before
3.1.1, and the DHCP server in EMC VMware Workstation before 5.5.5 Build
56455 and 6.x before 6.0.1 Build 55017, Player before 1.0.5 Build 56455
and Player 2 before 2.0.1 Build 55017, ACE before 1.0.3 Build 54075 and
ACE 2 before 2.0.1 Build 55017, and Server before 1.0.4 Build 56528
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash)
or execute arbitrary code via a malformed DHCP packet with a large
dhcp-max-message-size that triggers a stack-based buffer overflow,
related to servers configured to send many DHCP options to clients
(CVE-2007-0062).

Stack-based buffer overflow in the script_write_params method in
client/dhclient.c in ISC DHCP dhclient 4.1 before 4.1.0p1, 4.0
before 4.0.1p1, 3.1 before 3.1.2p1, 3.0, and 2.0 allows remote DHCP
servers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted subnet-mask option
(CVE-2009-0692).

ISC DHCP Server is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the
improper handling of DHCP requests. If the host definitions are mixed
using dhcp-client-identifier and hardware ethernet, a remote attacker
could send specially-crafted DHCP requests to cause the server to
stop responding (CVE-2009-1892).

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
Corporate products.

This update provides fixes for this vulnerability.
