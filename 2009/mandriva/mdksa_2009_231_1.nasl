Buffer overflow in the set_page_size function in util.cxx in HTMLDOC

arbitrary code via a long MEDIA SIZE comment.  NOTE: it was later
reported that there were additional vectors in htmllib.cxx and
ps-pdf.cxx using an AFM font file with a long glyph name, but these
vectors do not cross privilege boundaries (CVE-2009-3050).

This update provides a solution to this vulnerability.

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
