gnutls-cli in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not verify the activation
and expiration times of X.509 certificates, which allows remote
attackers to successfully present a certificate that is (1) not yet
valid or (2) no longer valid, related to lack of time checks in the
_gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in
libgnutls_x509, as used by (a) Exim, (b) OpenLDAP, and (c) libsoup
(CVE-2009-1417).

A vulnerability have been discovered and corrected in GnuTLS
before 2.8.2, which could allow man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
Certification Authority (CVE-2009-2730).

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
Corporate products.

This update fixes this vulnerability.
