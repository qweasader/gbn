and 9.0.x through 9.3.x with DNSSEC validation enabled and checking
disabled (CD), allows remote attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning
attacks via additional sections in a response sent for resolution
of a recursive client query, which is not properly handled when the
response is processed at the same time as requesting DNSSEC records
(DO). (CVE-2009-4022).

Additionally BIND has been upgraded to the latest point release or
closest supported version by ISC.

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
