The Admin media handler in core/servers/basehttp.py in Django 1.0
and 0.96 does not properly map URL requests to expected static media
files, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal
attacks and read arbitrary files via a crafted URL (CVE-2009-2659).

The versions of Django shipping with Mandriva Linux have been updated
to the latest patched version that include the fix for this issue.
In addition, they provide other bug fixes.
