  - Mode 6 Information Disclosure:

  Mode 6 queries can often be used to obtain system information such as system and kernel versions.

  - Mode 6 Amplification Attacks:

  An Amplification attack is a popular form of DDoS that relies on the use of publicly accessible
  NTP services to overwhelm a victim system with response traffic.

  The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a valid query request to a NTP service
  with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address. When the Memcached server sends the
  response, it is sent instead to the victim. Attackers will typically first inserting records into
  the open server to maximize the amplification effect. Because the size of the response is
  typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker is able to amplify the volume of
  traffic directed at the victim. By leveraging a botnet to perform additional spoofed queries, an
  attacker can produce an overwhelming amount of traffic with little effort. Additionally, because
  the responses are legitimate data coming from valid clients, it is especially difficult to block
  these types of attacks.");
