  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Angelo Prado, Neal Harris and Yoel Gluck reported that SSL/TLS
  attacks are still viable via a 'BREACH' (Browser Reconnaissance & Exfiltration via Adaptive
  Compression of Hypertext) attack, which they describe as:

  While CRIME was mitigated by disabling TLS/SPDY compression (and by modifying gzip to allow for
  explicit separation of compression contexts in SPDY), BREACH attacks HTTP responses. These are
  compressed using the common HTTP compression, which is much more common than TLS-level
  compression. This allows essentially the same attack demonstrated by Duong and Rizzo, but without
  relying on TLS-level compression (as they anticipated).

  It is important to note that the attack is agnostic to the version of TLS/SSL, and does not
  require TLS-layer compression. Additionally, the attack works against any cipher suite. Against a
  stream cipher, the attack is simpler: The difference in sizes across response bodies is much more
  granular in this case. If a block cipher is used, additional work must be done to align the output
  to the cipher text blocks.");

  - Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodies");

  1. Disabling HTTP compression

  2. Separating secrets from user input

  3. Randomizing secrets per request

  4. Masking secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random secret per request)

  5. Protecting vulnerable pages with CSRF

  6. Length hiding (by adding random number of bytes to the responses)

  7. Rate-limiting the requests

  Note: The mitigations are ordered by effectiveness (not by their practicality - as this may differ
  from one application to another).");
