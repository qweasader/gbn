  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"- CVE-2003-0196:

  A buffer overrun condition exists in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment
  re-assembly code in smbd which would allow an attacker to cause smbd
  to overwrite arbitrary areas of memory in its own process address
  space. This could allow a skilled attacker to inject binary specific
  exploit code into smbd.

  This version of Samba adds explicit overrun and overflow checks on
  fragment re-assembly of SMB/CIFS packets to ensure that only valid
  re-assembly is performed by smbd.

  In addition, the same checks have been added to the re-assembly
  functions in the client code, making it safe for use in other
  services.

  - CVE-2003-0201:

  This vulnerability, if exploited correctly, leads to an anonymous
  user gaining root access on a Samba serving system. All versions
  of Samba up to and including Samba 2.2.8 are vulnerable. An active
  exploit of the bug has been reported in the wild. Alpha versions of
  Samba 3.0 and above are *NOT* vulnerable.");
