  users and groups.

  The winbindd daemon included in Samba 3.0.21 and subsequent
  patch releases (3.0.21a-c) writes the clear text of server's
  machine credentials to its log file at level 5.  The winbindd
  log files are world readable by default and often log files
  are requested on open mailing lists as tools used to debug
  server misconfigurations.

  to use winbindd).");
