  junctions when deleting files could allow a local Windows user to delete files otherwise not
  deletable by the user.

  The vulnerability is due to insufficient checking for junctions in the directory from which the
  installer deletes files, which is writable by standard users. A malicious local user could exploit
  this vulnerability by creating a junction in the affected directory that points to protected
  system files or other files to which the user does not have permissions. Upon running the Zoom
  Windows installer with elevated permissions, as is the case when it is run through managed
  deployment software, those files would get deleted from the system.");
