  - CVE-2014-3566: OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications to block
  the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol downgrade. Some client applications (such as
  browsers) will reconnect using a downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older
  servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to downgrade connections to SSL
  3.0 even if both sides of the connection support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of
  weaknesses including POODLE.

  - CVE-2014-3567: When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the integrity of
  that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL
  will fail to free memory causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
  tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service attack.

  - CVE-2014-3568: When OpenSSL is configured with 'no-ssl3' as a build option, servers could accept
  and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be configured to send them.");
