  computation if an incorrect block cipher padding is used, which causes an information leak

  distinguishing between padding and MAC verification errors, possibly leading to extraction of
  the original plaintext, aka the 'Vaudenay timing attack'.");

  ciphertext blocks for blocks sent by legitimate SSL/TLS parties and measure the time
  until a response arrives: SSL/TLS includes data authentication to ensure that such
  modified ciphertext blocks will be rejected by the peer (and the connection aborted),
  but the attacker may be able to use timing observations to distinguish between two
  different error cases, namely block cipher padding errors and MAC verification errors.
  This is sufficient for an adaptive attack that finally can obtain the complete plaintext block.");
