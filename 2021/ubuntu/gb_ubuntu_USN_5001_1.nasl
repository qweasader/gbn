  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking
protocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free
vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2021-3609)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation did
not properly clear received fragments from memory in some situations. A
physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject
packets or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-24586)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation
incorrectly handled encrypted fragments. A physically proximate attacker
could possibly use this issue to decrypt fragments. (CVE-2020-24587)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation
incorrectly handled certain malformed frames. If a user were tricked into
connecting to a malicious server, a physically proximate attacker could use
this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-24588)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation
incorrectly handled EAPOL frames from unauthenticated senders. A physically
proximate attacker could inject malicious packets to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2020-26139)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation did
not properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate
attacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets.
(CVE-2020-26141)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation
accepted plaintext fragments in certain situations. A physically proximate
attacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-26145)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation could
reassemble mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A physically proximate
attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or exfiltrate
selected fragments. (CVE-2020-26147)

Or Cohen discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free
condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23133)

Or Cohen and Nadav Markus discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the
nfc implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could
use this issue to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23134)

Manfred Paul discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)
implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2021-31440)

It was discovered that a race condition in the kernel Bluetooth subsystem
could lead to use-after-free of slab objects. An attacker could use this
issue to possibly execute arbitrary code. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
