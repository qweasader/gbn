  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Ryota Shiga discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly verify that a BPF program only reserved as much memory for a
ring buffer as was allocated. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3489)

Manfred Paul discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly track bounds on bitwise operations. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2021-3490)

Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong discovered that the io_uring implementation of the
Linux kernel did not properly enforce the MAX_RW_COUNT limit in some
situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3491)

Kiyin (Yin Liang ) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)

Kiyin (Yin Liang ) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error
situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)

It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux
kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2021-28688)

It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained
a race condition leading to a deadlock condition. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-28951)

John Stultz discovered that the audio driver for Qualcomm SDM845 systems in
the Linux kernel did not properly validate port ID numbers. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28952)

Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations.
A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)

Vince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell
processors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)

It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading
to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
