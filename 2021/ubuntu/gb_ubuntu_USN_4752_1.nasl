  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen discovered
that legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in the
Bluetooth protocol could allow an unauthenticated user to complete
authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to impersonate a previously
paired Bluetooth device. (CVE-2020-10135)

Jay Shin discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle directory access with broken indexing,
leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-14314)

It was discovered that the block layer implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to
a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-15436)

It was discovered that the serial port driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly initialize a pointer in some situations. A local attacker could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2020-15437)

Andy Nguyen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI event packet parser in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle event advertisements of certain sizes,
leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A physically proximate remote
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-24490)

It was discovered that the NFS client implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly perform bounds checking before copying security labels in
some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25212)

It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform privilege checks for access to rbd devices
in some situations. A local attacker could use this to map or unmap rbd
block devices. (CVE-2020-25284)

It was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle zero-length requests. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-25641)

It was discovered that the HDLC PPP implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly validate input in some situations. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25643)

Kiyin (Yin Liang ) discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A privileged attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2020-25704)

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor in the Linux kernel did not
properly handle interrupts in certain situations. A local attacker in a
guest VM could ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
