kernel did not properly perform size validations on incoming packets in
some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive
information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-3655)

It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver in
the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error
conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764)

It was discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a
use-after-free vulnerability in its NFC Controller Interface (NCI)
implementation. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3760)

It was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in the eBPF
implementation in the Linux kernel when preallocating objects for stack
maps. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-41864)

It was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the
Linux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be
resolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2021-43056)

It was discovered that the ISDN CAPI implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition in certain situations that could trigger an
array out-of-bounds bug. A privileged local attacker could possibly use
this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.
