  loopback addresses in the range of 127.x.x.x. However, it was observed that when sending a CONNECT request
  with the XOR-PEER-ADDRESS value of 0.0.0.0, a successful response was received and subsequently,
  CONNECTIONBIND also received a successful response. Coturn then is able to relay packets to the loopback
  interface.

  Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also be reached
  by making use of either [::1] or [::] as the peer address.");
