Security issues fixed:
Fixed multiple access violations introduced by XENMEM_exchange hypercall
 which could allow a single PV guest to leak arbitrary amounts of memory,
 leading to a denial of service (bsc#1126192).

Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious unprivileged guest
 userspace process to escalate its privilege to that of other userspace
 processes in the same guest and potentially thereby to that
 of the guest operating system (bsc#1126201).

Fixed an issue which could allow an untrusted PV domain with access to a
 physical device to DMA into its own pagetables leading to privilege
 escalation (bsc#1126195).

Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious or buggy x86 PV guest
 kernels can mount a Denial of Service attack affecting the whole system
 (bsc#1126196).

CVE-2019-6778: Fixed a heap buffer overflow in tcp_emu() found in slirp
 (bsc#1123157).

Fixed an issue which could allow malicious PV guests may cause a host
 crash or gain access to data pertaining to other guests.Additionally,
 vulnerable configurations are likely to be unstable even in the absence
 of an attack (bsc#1126198).

Fixed an issue which could allow malicious 64bit PV guests to cause a
 host crash (bsc#1127400).

Fixed an issue which could allow malicious or buggy guests with passed
 through PCI devices to be able to escalate their privileges, crash the
 host, or access data belonging to other guests. Additionally memory
 leaks were also possible (bsc#1126140).

Fixed a race condition issue which could allow malicious PV guests to
 escalate their privilege to that
 of the hypervisor (bsc#1126141).

CVE-2019-9824: Fixed an information leak in SLiRP networking
 implementation which could allow a user/process to read uninitialised
 stack memory contents (bsc#1129623).

Other issues fixed:
Fixed an issue where VMs crashing when migrating between dom0 hosts
 (bsc#1031382).

Upstream bug fixes (bsc#1027519)");
