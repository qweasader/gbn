Security issue fixed:

This release resolves CVE-2020-14370, in which environment variables
 could be leaked between containers created using the Varlink API
 (bsc#1176804).

Non-security issues fixed:

add dependency to timezone package or podman fails to build a container
 (bsc#1178122)

Install new auto-update system units

Update to v2.1.1 (bsc#1178392):
 * Changes
 - The `podman info` command now includes the cgroup manager Podman is
 using.
 * API
 - The REST API now includes a Server header in all responses.
 - Fixed a bug where the Libpod and Compat Attach endpoints could
 terminate early, before sending all output from the container.
 - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for containers did not
 properly handle the Interactive parameter.
 - Fixed a bug where the Compat Kill endpoint for containers could
 continue to run after a fatal error.
 - Fixed a bug where the Limit parameter of the Compat List endpoint
 for Containers did not properly handle a limit of 0 (returning
 nothing, instead of all containers) [#7722].
 - The Libpod Stats endpoint for containers is being deprecated and
 will be replaced by a similar endpoint with additional features in a
 future release.

Changes in v2.1.0
 * Features
 - A new command, `podman image mount`, has been added. This allows for
 an image to be mounted, read-only, to inspect its contents without
 creating a container from it [#1433].
 - The `podman save` and `podman load` commands can now create and load
 archives containing multiple images [#2669].
 - Rootless Podman now supports all `podman network` commands, and
 rootless containers can now be joined to networks.
 - The performance of `podman build` on `ADD` and `COPY` instructions
 has been greatly improved, especially when a `.dockerignore` is
 present.
 - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new mode
 for the `--cgroups` option, `--cgroups=split`. Podman will create
 two cgroups under the cgroup it was launched in, one for the
 container and one for Conmon. This mode is useful for running Podman
 in a systemd unit, as it ensures that all processes are retained in
 systemd's cgroup hierarchy [#6400].
 - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now specify
 options to slirp4netns by using the `--network` option as follows:
`--net slirp4netns:opt1,opt2`. This allows for, among other things,
switching the port forwarder used by slirp4netns away from rootlessport.
 - The `podman ps` command now features a new option, `--storage`, to
 show containers from Buildah, CRI-O and other applications.
 - The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a
 `--sdnotify` option to control the behavior of systemd's sdnotify
 with containers, enabling improved support for Podman in
 `Type=notify` units.
 - The `podman run` command now features a `--preserve-fds`
 opton to pass file ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
