 *

 MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request header compression leads to information leakage, which can allow the extraction of private data such as session cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)

 *

 MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

 In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

 *

 CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and moz_bug_r_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox 15.

 *

 CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.

 *

 MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher David Bloom of Cue discovered that 'select' elements are always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away from a page with an active 'select' menu does not remove this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on a new page, the original 'select' menu can be retained and arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was well.

 In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

 MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5 specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a new document.domain but the observed violation allowed pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
