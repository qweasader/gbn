These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2017-2620: In CIRRUS_BLTMODE_MEMSYSSRC mode the bitblit copy routine
 cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo failed to check the memory region, allowing for
 an out-of-bounds write that allows for privilege escalation (bsc#1024972)
- CVE-2017-2615: An error in the bitblt copy operation could have allowed
 a malicious guest administrator to cause an out of bounds memory access,
 possibly leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation
 (bsc#1023004)
- CVE-2017-5856: The MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation
 support was vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged
 user to leak host memory resulting in DoS (bsc#1023053)
- CVE-2016-9776: The ColdFire Fast Ethernet Controller emulator support
 was vulnerable to an infinite loop issue while receiving packets in
 'mcf_fec_receive'. A privileged user/process inside guest could have
 used this issue to crash the Qemu process on the host leading to DoS
 (bsc#1013285)
- CVE-2016-9911: The USB EHCI Emulation support was vulnerable to a memory
 leakage issue while processing packet data in 'ehci_init_transfer'. A
 guest user/process could have used this issue to leak host memory,
 resulting in DoS for the host (bsc#1014111)
- CVE-2016-9907: The USB redirector usb-guest support was vulnerable to a
 memory leakage flaw when destroying the USB redirector in
 'usbredir_handle_destroy'. A guest user/process could have used this
 issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for a host (bsc#1014109)
- CVE-2016-9921: The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support was vulnerable
 to a divide by zero issue while copying VGA data. A privileged user
 inside guest could have used this flaw to crash the process instance on
 the host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1014702)
- CVE-2016-9922: The Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support was vulnerable
 to a divide by zero issue while copying VGA data. A privileged user
 inside guest could have used this flaw to crash the process instance on
 the host, resulting in DoS (bsc#1014702)
- CVE-2016-10155: The virtual hardware watchdog 'wdt_i6300esb' was
 vulnerable to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user to cause
 a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host (bsc#1021129)
- CVE-2017-5526: The ES1370 audio device emulation support was vulnerable
 to a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to
 cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host
 (bsc#1020589)
- CVE-2017-5525: The ac97 audio device emulation support was vulnerable to
 a memory leakage issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to
 cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host
 (bsc#1020491)
- CVE-2017-5667: The SDHCI device emulation support was vulnerable to an
 OOB heap access issue allowing a privileged user inside the guest to
 crash the Qemu process ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
