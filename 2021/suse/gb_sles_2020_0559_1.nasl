The following security bugs were fixed:
CVE-2020-2732: Fixed an issue affecting Intel CPUs where an L2 guest may
 trick the L0 hypervisor into accessing sensitive L1 resources
 (bsc#1163971).

CVE-2020-8992: An issue was discovered in ext4_protect_reserved_inode in
 fs/ext4/block_validity.c that allowed attackers to cause a soft lockup
 via a crafted journal size (bnc#1164069).

CVE-2020-8648: There was a use-after-free vulnerability in the
 n_tty_receive_buf_common function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c (bnc#1162928).

CVE-2020-8428: There was a use-after-free bug in fs/namei.c, which
 allowed local users to cause a denial of service or possibly obtain
 sensitive information from kernel memory (bnc#1162109).

CVE-2020-7053: There was a use-after-free (write) in the
 i915_ppgtt_close function in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_gtt.c
 (bnc#1160966).

CVE-2019-19045: A memory leak in
 drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/fpga/conn.c allowed attackers to
 cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering
 mlx5_vector2eqn() failures (bnc#1161522).

CVE-2019-16994: A memory leak existed in sit_init_net() in
 net/ipv6/sit.c which might have caused denial of service (bnc#1161523).

CVE-2019-19054: A memory leak in the cx23888_ir_probe() function in
 drivers/media/pci/cx23885/cx23888-ir.c allowed attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering kfifo_alloc()
 failures (bnc#1161518).

CVE-2019-14896: A heap overflow was found in the add_ie_rates() function
 of the Marvell Wifi Driver (bsc#1157157).

CVE-2019-14897: A stack overflow was found in the
 lbs_ibss_join_existing() function of the Marvell Wifi Driver
 (bsc#1157155).

CVE-2019-19318: Mounting a crafted btrfs image twice could have caused a
 use-after-free (bnc#1158026).

CVE-2019-19036: An issue discovered in btrfs_root_node in
 fs/btrfs/ctree.c allowed a NULL pointer dereference because
 rcu_dereference(root->node) can be zero (bnc#1157692).

CVE-2019-14615: An information disclosure vulnerability existed due to
 insufficient control flow in certain data structures for some Intel(R)
 Processors (bnc#1160195).

CVE-2019-19965: There was a NULL pointer dereference in
 drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_discover.c because of mishandling of port
 disconnection during discovery, related to a PHY down race condition
 (bnc#1159911).

CVE-2019-20095: Fixed a memory leak and denial of service in
 mwifiex_tm_cmd in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/cfg80211.c, where
 some error-handling cases did not free allocated hostcmd memory
 (bnc#1159909).

CVE-2019-20054: Fixed a NULL pointer dereference in drop_sysctl_table()
 in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c related to put_links (bnc#1159910).

CVE-2019-20096: Fixed a memory leak in __feat_register_sp() in
 net/dccp/feat.c, which may cause denial of service ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
