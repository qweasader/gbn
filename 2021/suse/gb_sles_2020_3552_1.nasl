binutils was updated to version 2.35.1 (jsc#ECO-2373)

Additional branch fixes applied on top of 2.35.1:

Fixes PR26520, aka [bsc#1179036], a problem in addr2line with certain
 DWARF variable descriptions.

Also fixes PR26711, PR26656, PR26655, PR26929, PR26808, PR25878,
 PR26740, PR26778, PR26763, PR26685, PR26699, PR26902, PR26869, PR26711

The above includes fixes for dwo files produced by modern dwp, fixing
 several problems in the DWARF reader.

Update to binutils 2.35.1 and rebased branch diff:

This is a point release over the previous 2.35 version, containing bug
 fixes, and as an exception to the usual rule, one new feature. The new
 feature is the support for a new directive in the assembler: '.nop'.
 This directive creates a single no-op instruction in whatever encoding
 is correct for the target architecture. Unlike the .space or .fill this
 is a real instruction, and it does affect the generation of DWARF line
 number tables, should they be enabled.

Update to binutils 2.35:

The assembler can now produce DWARF-5 format line number tables.

Readelf now has a 'lint' mode to enable extra checks of the files it is
 processing.

Readelf will now display '[...]' when it has to truncate a symbol name.
 The old behaviour - of displaying as many characters as possible, up to
 the 80 column limit - can be restored by the use of the
 --silent-truncation
 option.

The linker can now produce a dependency file listing the inputs that it
 has processed, much like the -M -MP option supported by the compiler.

fix DT_NEEDED order with -flto [bsc#1163744]


Update to binutils 2.34:

The disassembler (objdump --disassemble) now has an option to generate
 ascii art thats show the arcs between that start and end points of
 control flow instructions.

The binutils tools now have support for debuginfod. Debuginfod is a
 HTTP service for distributing ELF/DWARF debugging information as well as
 source code. The tools can now connect to debuginfod servers in order
 to download debug information about the files that they are processing.

The assembler and linker now support the generation of ELF format files
 for the Z80 architecture.

Add new subpackages for libctf and libctf-nobfd.

Disable LTO due to bsc#1163333.

Includes fixes for these CVEs: bsc#1153768 aka CVE-2019-17451 aka
 PR25070 bsc#1153770 aka CVE-2019-17450 aka PR25078

fix various build fails on aarch64 (PR25210, bsc#1157755).

Update to binutils 2.33.1:

Adds support for the Arm Scalable Vector Extension version 2 (SVE2)
 instructions, the Arm Transactional Memory Extension (TME) instructions
 and the Armv8.1-M Mainline and M-profile Vector Extension (MVE)
 instructions.

Adds support for the Arm Cortex-A76AE, Cortex-A77 and Cortex-M35P
 processors and the AArch64 Cortex-A34, Cortex-A65, Cortex-A65AE,
 Cortex-A76AE, and Cortex-A77 processors.

Adds a .float16 ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
