- CVE-2015-5041: Could could have invoked non-public interface methods
 under certain circumstances
- CVE-2015-7575: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected
 security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function
 for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An
 attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle
 techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials
- CVE-2015-7981: libpng could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
 information, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the
 png_convert_to_rfc1123 function. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability to obtain sensitive information
- CVE-2015-8126: buffer overflow in libpng caused by improper bounds
 checking by the png_set_PLTE() and png_get_PLTE() functions
- CVE-2015-8472: buffer overflow in libpng caused by improper bounds
 checking by the png_set_PLTE() and png_get_PLTE() functions
- CVE-2015-8540: libpng is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by a
 read underflow in png_check_keyword in pngwutil.c. By sending an overly
 long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute
 arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
- CVE-2016-0402: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Networking
 component has no confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and
 no availability impact
- CVE-2016-0448: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JMX component
 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information
- CVE-2016-0466: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JAXP
 component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
- CVE-2016-0483: An unspecified vulnerability related to the AWT component
 has complete confidentiality impact, complete integrity impact, and
 complete availability impact
- CVE-2016-0494: An unspecified vulnerability related to the 2D component
 has complete confidentiality impact, complete integrity impact, and
 complete availability impact The following bugs were fixed:
- bsc#960402: resolve package conflicts in devel package");
