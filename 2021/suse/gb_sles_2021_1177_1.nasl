The following security bugs were fixed:

CVE-2021-3444: Fixed an issue with the bpf verifier which did not
 properly handle mod32 destination register truncation when the source
 register was known to be 0 leading to out of bounds read (bsc#1184170).

CVE-2021-3428: Fixed an integer overflow in ext4_es_cache_extent
 (bsc#1173485).

CVE-2021-29647: Fixed an issue in qrtr_recvmsg which could have allowed
 attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of
 a partially uninitialized data structure (bsc#1184192 ).

CVE-2021-29265: Fixed an issue in usbip_sockfd_store which could have
 allowed attackers to cause a denial of service due to race conditions
 during an update of the local and shared status (bsc#1184167).

CVE-2021-29264: Fixed an issue in the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver
 which could have allowed attackers to cause a system crash due to a
 calculation of negative fragment size (bsc#1184168).

CVE-2021-28972: Fixed a user-tolerable buffer overflow when writing a
 new device name to the driver from userspace, allowing userspace to
 write data to the kernel stack frame directly (bsc#1184198).

CVE-2021-28971: Fixed an issue in intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm which could
 have caused a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record was
 mishandled (bsc#1184196 ).

CVE-2021-28964: Fixed a race condition in get_old_root which could have
 allowed attackers to cause a denial of service (bsc#1184193).

CVE-2021-28688: Fixed an issue introduced by XSA-365 (bsc#1183646).

CVE-2021-28660: Fixed an out of bounds write in rtw_wx_set_scan
 (bsc#1183593 ).

CVE-2021-28375: Fixed an issue in fastrpc_internal_invoke which did not
 prevent user applications from sending kernel RPC messages (bsc#1183596).

CVE-2021-28038: Fixed an issue with the netback driver which was lacking
 necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations
 (bsc#1183022).

CVE-2021-27365: Fixed an issue where an unprivileged user can send a
 Netlink message that is associated with iSCSI, and has a length up to
 the maximum length of a Netlink message (bsc#1182715).

CVE-2021-27364: Fixed an issue where an attacker could craft Netlink
 messages (bsc#1182717).

CVE-2021-27363: Fixed a kernel pointer leak which could have been used
 to determine the address of the iscsi_transport structure (bsc#1182716).

CVE-2020-35519: Fixed an out-of-bounds memory access was found in
 x25_bind (bsc#1183696).

CVE-2020-27815: Fixed an issue in JFS filesystem where could have
 allowed an attacker to execute code (bsc#1179454).

CVE-2020-27171: Fixed an off-by-one error affecting out-of-bounds
 speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that
 defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel
 memory (bsc#1183775).

CVE-2020-27170: Fixed potential ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
