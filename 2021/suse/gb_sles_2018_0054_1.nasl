These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2017-13767: The MSDP dissector could have gone into an infinite
 loop. This was addressed by adding length validation (bsc#1056248)
- CVE-2017-13766: The Profinet I/O dissector could have crash with an
 out-of-bounds write. This was addressed by adding string validation
 (bsc#1056249)
- CVE-2017-13765: The IrCOMM dissector had a buffer over-read and
 application crash. This was addressed by adding length validation
 (bsc#1056251)
- CVE-2017-9766: PROFINET IO data with a high recursion depth allowed
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion) in the
 dissect_IODWriteReq function (bsc#1045341)
- CVE-2017-9617: Deeply nested DAAP data may have cause stack exhaustion
 (uncontrolled recursion) in the dissect_daap_one_tag function in the
 DAAP dissector (bsc#1044417)
- CVE-2017-15192: The BT ATT dissector could crash. This was addressed in
 epan/dissectors/packet-btatt.c by considering a case where not all
 of the BTATT packets have the same encapsulation level. (bsc#1062645)
- CVE-2017-15193: The MBIM dissector could crash or exhaust system memory.
 This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mbim.c by changing the
 memory-allocation approach. (bsc#1062645)
- CVE-2017-15191: The DMP dissector could crash. This was addressed in
 epan/dissectors/packet-dmp.c by validating a string length. (bsc#1062645)
- CVE-2017-17083: NetBIOS dissector could crash. This was addressed in
 epan/dissectors/packet-netbios.c by ensuring that write operations are
 bounded by the beginning of a buffer. (bsc#1070727)
- CVE-2017-17084: IWARP_MPA dissector could crash. This was addressed in
 epan/dissectors/packet-iwarp-mpa.c by validating a ULPDU length.
 (bsc#1070727)
- CVE-2017-17085: the CIP Safety dissector could crash. This was addressed
 in epan/dissectors/packet-cipsafety.c by validating the packet length.
