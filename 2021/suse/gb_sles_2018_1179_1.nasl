  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for tiff fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2016-9453: The t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile function allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash)
 or possibly execute arbitrary code via a JPEG file with a
 TIFFTAG_JPEGTABLES of length one (bsc#1011107).
- CVE-2016-5652: An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow existed in the
 handling of TIFF images in the TIFF2PDF tool. A crafted TIFF document
 can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow resulting in remote code
 execution. Vulnerability can be triggered via a saved TIFF file
 delivered by other means (bsc#1007280).
- CVE-2017-11335: There is a heap based buffer overflow in
 tools/tiff2pdf.c via a PlanarConfig=Contig image, which caused a more
 than one hundred bytes out-of-bounds write (related to the ZIPDecode
 function in tif_zip.c). A crafted input may lead to a remote denial of
 service attack or an arbitrary code execution attack (bsc#1048937).
- CVE-2016-9536: tools/tiff2pdf.c had an out-of-bounds write
 vulnerabilities in heap allocated buffers in t2p_process_jpeg_strip().
 Reported as MSVR 35098, aka 't2p_process_jpeg_strip
 heap-buffer-overflow.' (bsc#1011845)
- CVE-2017-9935: In LibTIFF, there was a heap-based buffer overflow in the
 t2p_write_pdf function in tools/tiff2pdf.c. This heap overflow could
 lead to different damages. For example, a crafted TIFF document can lead
 to an out-of-bounds read in TIFFCleanup, an invalid free in TIFFClose or
 t2p_free, memory corruption in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image, or a double free
 in t2p_free. Given these possibilities, it probably could cause
 arbitrary code execution (bsc#1046077).
- CVE-2017-17973: There is a heap-based use-after-free in the
 t2p_writeproc function in tiff2pdf.c. (bsc#1074318)
- CVE-2015-7554: The _TIFFVGetField function in tif_dir.c allowed
 attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory write and crash)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted field data in an
 extension tag in a TIFF image (bsc#960341).
- CVE-2016-5318: Stack-based buffer overflow in the _TIFFVGetField
 function allowed remote attackers to crash the application via a crafted
 tiff (bsc#983436).
- CVE-2016-10095: Stack-based buffer overflow in the _TIFFVGetField
 function in tif_dir.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) via a crafted TIFF file (bsc#1017690,).
- CVE-2016-10268: tools/tiffcp.c allowed remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (integer underflow and heap-based buffer under-read)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF image,
 related to 'READ of size 78490' and libtiff/tif_unix.c:115:23
 (bsc#1031255)
- An overlapping of memcpy parameters was fixed which could lead to
 content corruption (bsc#1017691).
- Fixed an invalid memory read which could lead to a crash (bsc#1017692).
- Fixed a NULL pointer dereference in TIFFReadRawData (tiffinfo.c) that
 could crash the decoder (bsc#1017688).");
