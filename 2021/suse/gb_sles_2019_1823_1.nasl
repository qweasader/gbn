  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP 2 kernel was updated to receive various security and bugfixes.

The following security bugs were fixed:
CVE-2019-10638: In the Linux kernel, a device could be tracked by an
 attacker using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less
 protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic was sent to multiple
 destination IP addresses, it was possible to obtain hash collisions (of
 indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via
 enumeration). An attack may be conducted by hosting a crafted web page
 that uses WebRTC or gQUIC to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP
 addresses. (bnc#1140575)

CVE-2019-10639: The Linux kernel allowed Information Exposure (partial
 kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it
 was possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID
 values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and
 ICMP). When such traffic was sent to multiple destination IP addresses,
 it was possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter
 array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key
 contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so
 when the key was extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel
 image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the
 attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain
 other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to
 send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic
 is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client
 targets, if the target visited the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or
 gQUIC could be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP
 addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable because IP ID
 generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated
 with a network namespace. (bnc#)

CVE-2019-10126: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel that might lead to
 memory corruption in the marvell mwifiex driver. (bnc#1136935)

CVE-2018-20836: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel There was a
 race condition in smp_task_timedout() and smp_task_done() in
 drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c, leading to a use-after-free.
 (bnc#1134395)

CVE-2019-11599: The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel did not
 use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags
 changes while it ran, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive
 information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified
 other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget_not_zero or
 get_task_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c,
 fs/proc/task_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_main.c.
