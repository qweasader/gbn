The following security bugs were fixed:
CVE-2019-6974: kvm_ioctl_create_device in virt/kvm/kvm_main.c mishandled
 reference counting because of a race condition, leading to a
 use-after-free. (bnc#1124728)

CVE-2019-7221: Fixed a user-after-free vulnerability in the KVM
 hypervisor related to the emulation of a preemption timer, allowing an
 guest user/process to crash the host kernel. (bsc#1124732).

CVE-2019-7222: Fixed an information leakage in the KVM hypervisor
 related to handling page fault exceptions, which allowed a guest
 user/process to use this flaw to leak the host's stack memory contents
 to a guest (bsc#1124735).

CVE-2018-1120: By mmap()ing a FUSE-backed file onto a process's memory
 containing command line arguments (or environment strings), an attacker
 could have caused utilities from psutils or procps (such as ps, w) or
 any other program which made a read() call to the /proc//cmdline
 (or /proc//environ) files to block indefinitely (denial of service)
 or for some controlled time (as a synchronization primitive for other
 attacks) (bnc#1093158).

CVE-2018-16862: A security flaw was found in a way that the cleancache
 subsystem clears an inode after the final file truncation (removal). The
 new file created with the same inode may contain leftover pages from
 cleancache and the old file data instead of the new one (bnc#1117186).

CVE-2018-16884: NFS41+ shares mounted in different network namespaces at
 the same time can make bc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel IDs and
 cause a use-after-free vulnerability. Thus a malicious container user
 can cause a host kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the
 nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out
 (bnc#1119946).

CVE-2018-19407: The vcpu_scan_ioapic function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c
 allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
 dereference and BUG) via crafted system calls that reach a situation
 where ioapic is uninitialized (bnc#1116841).

CVE-2018-19824: A local user could exploit a use-after-free in the ALSA
 driver by supplying a malicious USB Sound device (with zero interfaces)
 that is mishandled in usb_audio_probe in sound/usb/card.c (bnc#1118152).

CVE-2018-19985: The function hso_probe read if_num from the USB device
 (as an u8) and used it without a length check to index an array,
 resulting in an OOB memory read in hso_probe or hso_get_config_data that
 could be used by local attackers (bnc#1120743).

CVE-2018-20169: The USB subsystem mishandled size checks during the
 reading of an extra descriptor, related to __usb_get_extra_descriptor in
 drivers/usb/core/usb.c (bnc#1119714).

CVE-2018-5391: The Linux kernel was vulnerable to a denial of service
 attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP
 fragment re-assembly. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
