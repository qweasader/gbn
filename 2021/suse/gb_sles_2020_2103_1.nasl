The following security bugs were fixed:

CVE-2020-15393: Fixed a memory leak in usbtest_disconnect (bnc#1173514).

CVE-2020-12771: An issue was discovered in btree_gc_coalesce in
 drivers/md/bcache/btree.c has a deadlock if a coalescing operation fails
 (bnc#1171732).

CVE-2020-12888: The VFIO PCI driver mishandled attempts to access
 disabled memory space (bnc#1171868).

CVE-2020-10773: Fixed a memory leak on s390/s390x, in the
 cmm_timeout_hander in file arch/s390/mm/cmm.c (bnc#1172999).

CVE-2020-14416: Fixed a race condition in tty->disc_data handling in the
 slip and slcan line discipline could lead to a use-after-free. This
 affects drivers/net/slip/slip.c and drivers/net/can/slcan.c
 (bnc#1162002).

CVE-2020-10768: Fixed an issue with the prctl() function, where indirect
 branch speculation could be enabled even though it was diabled before
 (bnc#1172783).

CVE-2020-10766: Fixed an issue which allowed an attacker with a local
 account to disable SSBD protection (bnc#1172781).

CVE-2020-10767: Fixed an issue where Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier
 was disabled in certain circumstances, leaving the system open to a
 spectre v2 style attack (bnc#1172782).

CVE-2020-13974: Fixed a integer overflow in drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c,
 if k_ascii is called several times in a row (bnc#1172775).

CVE-2019-20810: Fixed a memory leak in go7007_snd_init in
 drivers/media/usb/go7007/snd-go7007.c because it did not call
 snd_card_free for a failure path (bnc#1172458).

CVE-2020-10769: A buffer over-read flaw was found in
 crypto_authenc_extractkeys in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec
 Cryptographic algorithm's module, authenc. This flaw allowed a local
 attacker with user privileges to cause a denial of service (bnc#1173265).

CVE-2020-10781: Fixed a denial of service issue in the ZRAM
 implementation (bsc#1173074).

CVE-2020-0305: In cdev_get of char_dev.c, there is a possible
 use-after-free due to a race condition. This could lead to local
 escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
 interaction is not needed for exploitation (bsc#1174462).

CVE-2019-20908: An issue was discovered in drivers/firmware/efi/efi.c:
 incorrect access permissions for the efivar_ssdt ACPI variable could be
 used by attackers to bypass lockdown or secure boot restrictions, aka
 CID-1957a85b0032 (bsc#1173567).

CVE-2020-15780: An issue was discovered in drivers/acpi/acpi_configfs.c:
 injection of malicious ACPI tables via configfs could be used by
 attackers to bypass lockdown and secure boot restrictions, aka
 CID-75b0cea7bf30 (bsc#1173573).

The following non-security bugs were fixed:

ACPI: GED: add support for _Exx / _Lxx handler methods (bsc#1111666).

ACPI: GED: use correct trigger type field in _Exx / _Lxx handling
 (bsc#1111666).

ACPI: NFIT: Fix unlock on error in ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
