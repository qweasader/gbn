These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2014-9663: The tt_cmap4_validate function in sfnt/ttcmap.c in
 FreeType before 2.5.4 validates a certain length field before that
 field's value is completely calculated, which allowed remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted cmap SFNT table (bnc#916865).
- CVE-2014-9662: cff/cf2ft.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 did not validate the
 return values of point-allocation functions, which allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted OTF font
 (bnc#916860).
- CVE-2014-9661: type42/t42parse.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 did not
 consider that scanning can be incomplete without triggering an error,
 which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 Type42 font (bnc#916859).
- CVE-2014-9660: The _bdf_parse_glyphs function in bdf/bdflib.c in
 FreeType before 2.5.4 did not properly handle a missing ENDCHAR record,
 which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 crafted BDF font (bnc#916858).
- CVE-2014-9667: sfnt/ttload.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 proceeds with
 offset+length calculations without restricting the values, which allowed
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and
 out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 crafted SFNT table (bnc#916861).
- CVE-2014-9666: The tt_sbit_decoder_init function in sfnt/ttsbit.c in
 FreeType before 2.5.4 proceeds with a count-to-size association without
 restricting the count value, which allowed remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (integer overflow and out-of-bounds read) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted embedded bitmap (bnc#916862).
- CVE-2014-9665: The Load_SBit_Png function in sfnt/pngshim.c in FreeType
 before 2.5.4 did not restrict the rows and pitch values of PNG data,
 which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer
 overflow and heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact by embedding a PNG file in a .ttf font file (bnc#916863).
- CVE-2014-9664: FreeType before 2.5.4 did not check for the end of the
 data during certain parsing actions, which allowed remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted Type42 font, related to
 type42/t42parse.c and type1/t1load.c (bnc#916864).
- CVE-2014-9669: Multiple integer overflows in sfnt/ttcmap.c in FreeType
 before 2.5.4 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
