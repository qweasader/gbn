The following security bugs were fixed:


CVE-2020-10135: Legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing
 authentication in Bluetooth may have allowed an unauthenticated user to
 complete authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access.
 An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could impersonate a Bluetooth
 BR/EDR master or slave to pair with a previously paired remote device to
 successfully complete the authentication procedure without knowing the
 link key (bnc#1171988).

CVE-2020-10711: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the SELinux
 subsystem. This flaw occurs while importing the Commercial IP Security
 Option (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into the SELinux extensible
 bitmap via the' ebitmap_netlbl_import' routine. This flaw allowed a
 remote network user to crash the system kernel, resulting in a denial of
 service (bnc#1171191).

CVE-2020-10751: A flaw was found in the SELinux LSM hook implementation,
 where it incorrectly assumed that an skb would only contain a single
 netlink message. The hook would incorrectly only validate the first
 netlink message in the skb and allow or deny the rest of the messages
 within the skb with the granted permission without further processing
 (bnc#1171189).

CVE-2019-20812: An issue was discovered in the prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo()
 function in net/packet/af_packet.c can result in a denial of service
 (CPU consumption and soft lockup) in a certain failure case involving
 TPACKET_V3, aka CID-b43d1f9f7067 (bnc#1172453).

CVE-2020-10732: A flaw was found in the implementation of userspace core
 dumps. This flaw allowed an attacker with a local account to crash a
 trivial program and exfiltrate private kernel data (bnc#1171220).

CVE-2020-0305: In cdev_get of char_dev.c, there is a possible
 use-after-free due to a race condition. This could lead to local
 escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
 interaction is not needed for exploitation (bnc#1174462).

CVE-2020-12771: btree_gc_coalesce in drivers/md/bcache/btree.c had a
 deadlock if a coalescing operation fails (bnc#1171732).

CVE-2020-10773: A kernel stack information leak on s390/s390x was fixed
 (bnc#1172999).

CVE-2020-14416: A race condition in tty->disc_data handling in the slip
 and slcan line discipline could lead to a use-after-free, aka
 CID-0ace17d56824. This affects drivers/net/slip/slip.c and
 drivers/net/can/slcan.c (bnc#1162002).

CVE-2020-10768: Indirect branch speculation could have been enabled
 after it was force-disabled by the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE prctl command.
 (bnc#1172783).

CVE-2020-10766: Fixed Rogue cross-process SSBD shutdown, where a Linux
 scheduler logical bug allows an attacker to turn off the SSBD
 protection. (bnc#1172781).

CVE-2020-10767: Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier was force-disabled
