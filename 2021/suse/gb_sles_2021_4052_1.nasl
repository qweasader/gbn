The following security issues were fixed:

CVE-2021-0935: In ip6_xmit of ip6_output.c, there is a possible out of
 bounds write due to a use after free. This could lead to local
 escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
 interaction is not needed for exploitation. (bsc#1192032)

CVE-2021-28688: The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers
 such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale
 values. This initialization went too far and may under certain
 conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The
 lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in
 turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died,
 leaving around zombie domains. (bsc#1183646)");
