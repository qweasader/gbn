  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 kernel has been updated to fix various bugs and security issues.

The following security bugs have been fixed:

 *

 CVE-2014-1739: The media_device_enum_entities function in drivers/media/media-device.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14.6 does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to
 obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging
/dev/media0 read access for a MEDIA_IOC_ENUM_ENTITIES ioctl call
(bnc#882804).

 *

 CVE-2014-4171: mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 does not properly implement the interaction between range notification and hole punching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (i_mutex hold) by using the mmap system call to access a hole, as demonstrated by interfering with intended shmem activity by blocking completion of (1) an MADV_REMOVE madvise call or (2) an FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE fallocate call
(bnc#883518).

 *

 CVE-2014-4508: arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 on 32-bit x86 platforms, when syscall auditing is enabled and the sep CPU feature flag is set, allows local users to cause a denial
 of service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as demonstrated by number 1000 (bnc#883724).

 *

 CVE-2014-4667: The sctp_association_free function in net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not properly manage a certain backlog value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet (bnc#885422).

 *

 CVE-2014-4943: The PPPoL2TP feature in net/l2tp/l2tp_ppp.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.6 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging data-structure differences between an l2tp socket and an inet socket (bnc#887082).

 *

 CVE-2014-5077: The sctp_assoc_update function in net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.8, when SCTP authentication is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by starting to establish an association between two endpoints immediately after an exchange of INIT and INIT ACK chunks to establish an earlier association between these endpoints in the opposite direction (bnc#889173).

 *

 CVE-2014-5471: Stack consumption vulnerability in the parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service
(uncontrolled recursion, and system crash or reboot) via a crafted iso9660 image with a CL entry referring to a directory entry that has a CL entry.
(bnc#892490)

 *

 CVE-2014-5472: The parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process) via a crafted iso9660 image with a self-referential CL entry. (bnc#892490)
