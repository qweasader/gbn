CVE-2017-15996: readelf allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (excessive memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted ELF file that triggered a buffer overflow on fuzzed
 archive header (bsc#1065643)

CVE-2017-15939: Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd)
 mishandled NULL files in a .debug_line file table, which allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
 application crash) via a crafted ELF file, related to concat_filename
 (bsc#1065689)

CVE-2017-15938: the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd)
 miscalculated DW_FORM_ref_addr die refs in the case of a relocatable
 object file, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (find_abstract_instance_name invalid memory read, segmentation fault,
 and application crash) (bsc#1065693)

CVE-2017-16826: The coff_slurp_line_table function the Binary File
 Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) allowed remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (invalid memory access and application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file
 (bsc#1068640)

CVE-2017-16832: The pe_bfd_read_buildid function in the Binary File
 Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) did not validate size and offset
 values in the data dictionary, which allowed remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (segmentation violation and application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file
 (bsc#1068643)

CVE-2017-16831: Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) did
 not validate the symbol count, which allowed remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (integer overflow and application crash, or excessive
 memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 crafted PE file (bsc#1068887)

CVE-2017-16830: The print_gnu_property_note function did not have
 integer-overflow protection on 32-bit platforms, which allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 crafted ELF file (bsc#1068888)

CVE-2017-16829: The _bfd_elf_parse_gnu_properties function in the Binary
 File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) did not prevent negative
 pointers, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted ELF file (bsc#1068950)

CVE-2017-16828: The display_debug_frames function allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and heap-based
 buffer over-read, and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted ELF file (bsc#1069176)
