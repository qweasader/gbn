enhancements and bug fixes.
Thses security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2017-7700: In Wireshark the NetScaler file parser could go into an
 infinite loop, triggered by a malformed capture file. This was addressed
 in wiretap/netscaler.c by ensuring a nonzero record size (bsc#1033936)
- CVE-2017-7701: In Wireshark the BGP dissector could go into an infinite
 loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This
 was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-bgp.c by using a different
 integer data type (bsc#1033937)
- CVE-2017-7702: In Wireshark the WBXML dissector could go into an
 infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture
 file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding
 length validation (bsc#1033938)
- CVE-2017-7703: In Wireshark the IMAP dissector could crash, triggered by
 packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in
 epan/dissectors/packet-imap.c by calculating a line's end correctly
 (bsc#1033939)
- CVE-2017-7704: In Wireshark the DOF dissector could go into an infinite
 loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This
 was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dof.c by using a different
 integer data type and adjusting a return value (bsc#1033940)
- CVE-2017-7705: In Wireshark the RPC over RDMA dissector could go into an
 infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture
 file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-rpcrdma.c by
 correctly checking for going beyond the maximum offset (bsc#1033941)
- CVE-2017-7745: In Wireshark the SIGCOMP dissector could go into an
 infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture
 file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-sigcomp.c by
 correcting a memory-size check (bsc#1033942)
- CVE-2017-7746: In Wireshark the SLSK dissector could go into an infinite
 loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This
 was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-slsk.c by adding checks for the
 remaining length (bsc#1033943)
- CVE-2017-7747: In Wireshark the PacketBB dissector could crash,
 triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was
 addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-packetbb.c by restricting additions
 to the protocol tree (bsc#1033944)
- CVE-2017-7748: In Wireshark the WSP dissector could go into an infinite
 loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This
 was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wsp.c by adding a length check
 (bsc#1033945)
- CVE-2017-6014: In Wireshark a crafted or malformed STANAG 4607 capture
 file will cause an infinite loop and memory exhaustion. If the packet
 size field in a packet header is null, the offset to read from will not
 advance, causing continuous attempts to read the same zero length
 packet. This will quickly exhaust all ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
