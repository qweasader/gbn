CVE-2019-0211: A flaw in the Apache HTTP Server allowed less-privileged
 child processes or threads to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
 of the parent process. Attackers with control over CGI scripts or
 extension modules run by the server could have abused this issue to
 potentially gain super user privileges. [bsc#1131233]
CVE-2019-0220: The Apache HTTP server did not use a consistent strategy
 for URL normalization throughout all of its components. In particular,
 consecutive slashes were not always collapsed. Attackers could
 potentially abuse these inconsistencies to by-pass access control
 mechanisms and thus gain unauthorized access to protected parts of the
 service. [bsc#1131241]
CVE-2019-0217: A race condition in Apache's 'mod_auth_digest' when
 running in a threaded server could have allowed users with valid
 credentials to authenticate using another username, bypassing configured
 access control restrictions. [bsc#1131239]
CVE-2019-0197: When HTTP/2 support was enabled in the Apache server for
 a 'http' host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a 'https' host, an
 Upgrade request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the first request
 on a connection could lead to a misconfiguration and crash. This issue
 could have been abused to mount a denial-of-service attack. Servers that
 never enabled the h2 protocol or that only enabled it for https: and did
 not configure the 'H2Upgrade on' are unaffected. [bsc#1131245]
CVE-2019-0196: Through specially crafted network input the Apache's
 http/2 request handler could be lead to access previously freed memory
 while determining the method of a request. This resulted in the request
 being misclassified and thus being processed incorrectly. [bsc#1131237]");
