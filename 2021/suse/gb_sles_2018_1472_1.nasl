Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-5315: The setByteArray function in tif_dir.c allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a
 crafted tiff image. (bsc#984809)
- CVE-2016-10267: LibTIFF allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted TIFF
 image, related to libtiff/tif_ojpeg.c:816:8. (bsc#1017694)
- CVE-2016-10269: LibTIFF allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (heap-based buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted TIFF image, related to 'READ of size 512' and
 libtiff/tif_unix.c:340:2. (bsc#1031254)
- CVE-2016-10270: LibTIFF allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (heap-based buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted TIFF image, related to 'READ of size 8' and
 libtiff/tif_read.c:523:22. (bsc#1031250)
- CVE-2017-18013: In LibTIFF, there was a Null-Pointer Dereference in the
 tif_print.c TIFFPrintDirectory function, as demonstrated by a tiffinfo
 crash. (bsc#1074317)
- CVE-2017-7593: tif_read.c did not ensure that tif_rawdata is properly
 initialized, which might have allowed remote attackers to obtain
 sensitive information from process memory via a crafted image.
 (bsc#1033129)
- CVE-2017-7595: The JPEGSetupEncode function in tiff_jpeg.c allowed
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and
 application crash) via a crafted image. (bsc#1033127)
- CVE-2017-7596: LibTIFF had an 'outside the range of representable values
 of type float' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted image. (bsc#1033126)
- CVE-2017-7597: tif_dirread.c had an 'outside the range of representable
 values of type float' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.
 (bsc#1033120)
- CVE-2017-7599: LibTIFF had an 'outside the range of representable values
 of type short' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted image. (bsc#1033113)
- CVE-2017-7600: LibTIFF had an 'outside the range of representable values
 of type unsigned char' undefined behavior issue, which might have
 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.
 (bsc#1033112)
- CVE-2017-7601: LibTIFF had a 'shift exponent too large for 64-bit type
 long' undefined behavior issue, which might have allowed remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
 have ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
