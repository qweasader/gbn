See upstream changelog in the packaged

 CVE-2021-41092 CVE-2021-41089 CVE-2021-41091 CVE-2021-41103

container was updated to v1.4.11, to fix CVE-2021-41103. bsc#1191355

CVE-2021-32760: Fixed that a archive package allows chmod of file
 outside of unpack target directory (bsc#1188282)

Update to runc v1.0.2. Upstream changelog is available from

 [link moved to references]

Fixed a failure to set CPU quota period in some cases on cgroup v1.

Fixed the inability to start a container with the 'adding seccomp filter
 rule for syscall ...' error, caused by redundant seccomp rules (i.e.
 those that has action equal to the default one). Such redundant rules
 are now skipped.

Made release builds reproducible from now on.

Fixed a rare debug log race in runc init, which can result in occasional
 harmful 'failed to decode ...' errors from runc run or exec.

Fixed the check in cgroup v1 systemd manager if a container needs to be
 frozen before Set, and add a setting to skip such freeze
 unconditionally. The previous fix for that issue, done in runc 1.0.1,
 was not working.

Update to runc v1.0.1. Upstream changelog is available from

[link moved to references]

Fixed occasional runc exec/run failure ('interrupted system call') on an
 Azure volume.

Fixed 'unable to find groups ... token too long' error with /etc/group
 containing lines longer than 64K characters.

cgroup/systemd/v1: fix leaving cgroup frozen after Set if a parent
 cgroup is frozen. This is a regression in 1.0.0, not affecting runc
 itself but some
 of libcontainer users (e.g Kubernetes).

cgroupv2: bpf: Ignore inaccessible existing programs in case of
 permission error when handling replacement of existing bpf cgroup
 programs. This fixes a regression in 1.0.0, where some SELinux policies
 would block runc from being able to run entirely.

cgroup/systemd/v2: don't freeze cgroup on Set.

cgroup/systemd/v1: avoid unnecessary freeze on Set.

fix issues with runc under openSUSE MicroOS's SELinux policy. bsc#1187704

Update to runc v1.0.0. Upstream changelog is available from

[link moved to references]

! The usage of relative paths for mountpoints will now produce a warning
(such configurations are outside of the spec, and in future runc will produce an error when given such configurations).
cgroupv2: devices: rework the filter generation to produce consistent
 results with cgroupv1, and always clobber any existing eBPF program(s)
 to fix runc update and avoid leaking eBPF programs (resulting in errors
 when managing containers).

cgroupv2: correctly convert 'number of IOs' statistics in a
 cgroupv1-compatible way.

cgroupv2: support larger than 32-bit IO ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
