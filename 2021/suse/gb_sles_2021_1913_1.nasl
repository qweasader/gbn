The following security bugs were fixed:

CVE-2021-33200: Enforcing incorrect limits for pointer arithmetic
 operations by the BPF verifier could be abused to perform out-of-bounds
 reads and writes in kernel memory (bsc#1186484).

CVE-2021-33034: Fixed a use-after-free when destroying an hci_chan. This
 could lead to writing an arbitrary values. (bsc#1186111)

CVE-2020-26139: Fixed a denial-of-service when an Access Point (AP)
 forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not
 yet successfully authenticated to the AP. (bnc#1186062)

CVE-2021-23134: A Use After Free vulnerability in nfc sockets allowed
 local attackers to elevate their privileges. (bnc#1186060)

CVE-2021-3491: Fixed a potential heap overflow in mem_rw(). This
 vulnerability is related to the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, which allowed
 the MAX_RW_COUNT limit to be bypassed (bsc#1185642).

CVE-2021-32399: Fixed a race condition when removing the HCI controller
 (bnc#1184611).

CVE-2020-24586: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected
 Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't
 require that received fragments be cleared from memory after
 (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances this can be
 abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data
 (bnc#1185859).

CVE-2020-24587: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected
 Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't
 require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key.
 An adversary can abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another
 device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key
 is periodically renewed (bnc#1185859 bnc#1185862).

CVE-2020-26147: The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble
 fragments, even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This
 vulnerability can be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected
 fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP,
 or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used (bnc#1185859).

CVE-2020-26145: An issue was discovered with Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305
 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept
 second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext
 and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse
 this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network
 configuration. (bnc#1185860)

CVE-2020-26141: An issue was discovered in the ALFA driver for AWUS036H,
 where the Message Integrity Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP
 frames was not verified. An adversary can abuse this to inject and
 possibly decrypt packets in WPA or WPA2 networks that support the TKIP
 data-confidentiality protocol. (bnc#1185987)
