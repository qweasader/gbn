  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for openssl fixes various security issues:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the 'DROWN' attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
 vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
 TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
 as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
 This update changes the openssl library to:
 * Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
 This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
'OPENSSL_ALLOW_SSL2' or by using SSL_CTX_clear_options using the SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 flag.
 Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL protocol 2 by default previously.
 * Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be re-enabled if
 required by old legacy software using the environment variable
 'OPENSSL_ALLOW_EXPORT'.
- CVE-2016-0702 aka the 'CacheBleed' attack. (bsc#968050) Various changes
 in the modular exponentation code were added that make sure that it is
 not possible to recover RSA secret keys by analyzing cache-bank
 conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.
 Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
 on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
 thread performing decryptions.
- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047): A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser
 code was fixed that could be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service
 attack.
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN_hex2bn() and BN_dec2bn() functions
 had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
 leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
 functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
 hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
 uses data from config files or application command line arguments. If
 user developed applications generated config file data based on
 untrusted data, then this could have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265) The SRP user database lookup method
 SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() had a memory leak that attackers could abuse to
 facility DoS attacks. To mitigate the issue, the seed handling in
 SRP_VBASE_get_by_user() was disabled even if the user has configured a
 seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user().
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
 and doapr_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
 and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
 could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
 passed to the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions
 in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
 these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
 Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
 if the data is ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
