The following vulnerabilities were fixed:
* CVE-2015-1931: IBM Java Security Components store plain text data in
 memory dumps, which could allow a local attacker to obtain information
 to aid in further attacks against the system.
* CVE-2015-2590: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the Libraries
 component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via
 multiple protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have
 resulted in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary
 code execution.
* CVE-2015-2601: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JCE component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2621: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the JMX component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2625: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the JSSE
 component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via
 SSL/TLS. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in
 unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2632: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2637: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
* CVE-2015-2638: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the 2D component
 allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via multiple
 protocols. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted
 in unauthorized Operating System takeover including arbitrary code
 execution.
* CVE-2015-2664: Difficult to exploit vulnerability in the Deployment
 component requiring logon to Operating System. Successful attack of this
 vulnerability could have resulted in unauthorized Operating System
 takeover including arbitrary code execution.
* CVE-2015-2808: Very difficult to exploit vulnerability in the JSSE
 component allowed successful unauthenticated network attacks via
 SSL/TLS. Successful attack of this vulnerability could have resulted in
 unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some Java accessible
 data as well as read access to a subset of Java accessible data.
