  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for quagga fixes the following security issues:
- The Quagga BGP daemon contained a bug in the AS_PATH size calculation
 that could have been exploited to facilitate a remote denial-of-service
 attack via specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages. [CVE-2017-16227,
 bsc#1065641]
- The Quagga BGP daemon did not check whether data sent to peers via
 NOTIFY had an invalid attribute length. It was possible to exploit this
 issue and cause the bgpd process to leak sensitive information over the
 network to a configured peer. [CVE-2018-5378, bsc#1079798]
- The Quagga BGP daemon used to double-free memory when processing certain
 forms of UPDATE messages. This issue could be exploited by sending an
 optional/transitive UPDATE attribute that all conforming eBGP speakers
 should pass along. Consequently, a single UPDATE message could have
 affected many bgpd processes across a wide area of a network. Through
 this vulnerability, attackers could potentially have taken over control
 of affected bgpd processes remotely. [CVE-2018-5379, bsc#1079799]
- It was possible to overrun internal BGP code-to-string conversion tables
 in the Quagga BGP daemon. Configured peers could have exploited this
 issue and cause bgpd to emit debug and warning messages into the logs
 that would contained arbitrary bytes. [CVE-2018-5380, bsc#1079800]
- The Quagga BGP daemon could have entered an infinite loop if sent an
 invalid OPEN message by a configured peer. If this issue was exploited,
 then bgpd would cease to respond to any other events. BGP sessions would
 have been dropped and not be reestablished. The CLI interface would have
 been unresponsive. The bgpd daemon would have stayed in this state until
 restarted. [CVE-2018-5381, bsc#1079801]
- The Quagga daemon's telnet 'vty' CLI contains an unbounded memory
 allocation bug that could be exploited for a denial-of-service attack on
 the daemon. This issue has been fixed. [CVE-2017-5495, bsc#1021669]
- The telnet 'vty' CLI of the Quagga daemon is no longer enabled by
 default, because the passwords in the default 'zebra.conf' config file
 are now disabled. The vty interface is available via 'vtysh' utility
 using pam authentication to permit management access for root without
 password. [bsc#1021669]");
