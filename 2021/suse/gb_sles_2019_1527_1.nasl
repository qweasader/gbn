  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP3 kernel was updated to 4.4.180 to receive various security and bugfixes.

The following security bugs were fixed:
CVE-2019-11477: A sequence of SACKs may have been crafted such that one
 can trigger an integer overflow, leading to a kernel panic. (bsc#1137586)
CVE-2019-11478: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs
 which will fragment the TCP retransmission queue. An attacker may have
 been able to further exploit the fragmented queue to cause an expensive
 linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same TCP
 connection.
CVE-2019-11479: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs
 which will fragment the RACK send map. A remote attacker may be able to
 further exploit the fragmented send map to cause an expensive
 linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same TCP
 connection. This would have resulted in excess resource consumption due
 to low mss values.
CVE-2019-3846: A flaw that allowed an attacker to corrupt memory and
 possibly escalate privileges was found in the mwifiex kernel module
 while connecting to a malicious wireless network. (bnc#1136424)
CVE-2019-12382: An issue was discovered in drm_load_edid_firmware in
 drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid_load.c in the Linux kernel There was an
 unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a
 denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).
 (bnc#1136586)
CVE-2019-5489: The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c in the Linux
 kernel allowed local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of
 other processes on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of
 secret information. (Fixing this affects the output of the fincore
 program.) Limited remote exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated
 by latency differences in accessing public files from an Apache HTTP
 Server. (bnc#1120843).
CVE-2019-11833: fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel did not zero out
 the unused memory region in the extent tree block, which might allow
 local users to obtain sensitive information by reading uninitialized
 data in the filesystem. (bnc#1135281)
CVE-2018-7191: In the tun subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.13.14,
 dev_get_valid_name is not called before register_netdevice. This allowed
 local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
 panic) via an ioctl(TUNSETIFF) call with a dev name containing a /
 character. This is similar to CVE-2013-4343. (bnc#1135603)
CVE-2019-11190: The Linux kernel allowed local users to bypass ASLR on
 setuid programs (such as /bin/su) because install_exec_creds() is called
 too late in load_elf_binary() in fs/binfmt_elf.c, and thus the
 ptrace_may_access() check has a race condition when reading
 /proc/pid/stat. (bnc#1131543)
CVE-2019-11815: An issue was discovered in rds_tcp_kill_sock in
 net/rds/tcp.c in the Linux kernel There was a race condition leading to
 a ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
