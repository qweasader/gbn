  - CVE-2013-5704: HTTP trailers could be used to replace HTTP headers late during request
  processing, potentially undoing or otherwise confusing modules that examined or modified
  request headers earlier. This fix adds the 'MergeTrailers' directive to restore legacy behavior.

  - CVE-2014-0118: A resource consumption flaw was found in mod_deflate. If request body
  decompression was configured (using the 'DEFLATE' input filter), a remote attacker could cause
  the server to consume significant memory and/or CPU resources. The use of request body
  decompression is not a common configuration.

  - CVE-2014-0226: A race condition was found in mod_status. An attacker able to access a public
  server status page on a server using a threaded MPM could send a carefully crafted request which
  could lead to a heap buffer overflow. Note that it is not a default or recommended configuration
  to have a public accessible server status page.

  - CVE-2014-0231: A flaw was found in mod_cgid. If a server using mod_cgid hosted CGI scripts
  which did not consume standard input, a remote attacker could cause child processes to hang
  indefinitely, leading to denial of service.");
