  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was
  found in Apache Tapestry. The vulnerability is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195.

  Before the fix of CVE-2019-0195 it was possible to download arbitrary class files from the
  classpath by providing a crafted asset file URL. An attacker was able to download the file
  'AppModule.class' by requesting the path '/assets/something/services/AppModule.class'
  which contains a HMAC secret key.

  The fix for that bug was a blacklist filter that checks if the URL ends with '.class',
  '.properties' or '.xml'.

  Unfortunately, the blacklist solution can simply be bypassed by appending a '/' at the end of the
  path: '/assets/something/services/AppModule.class/'

  The slash is stripped after the blacklist check and the file 'AppModule.class' is loaded into
  the response.

  This class usually contains the HMAC secret key which is used to sign serialized Java objects.

  With the knowledge of that key an attacker can sign a Java gadget chain that leads to RCE
  (e.g. CommonsBeanUtils1 from ysoserial).");
