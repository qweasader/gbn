  The SPNEGO implementation used by BIND has been found to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.");

  script_tag(name:"impact", value:"BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version
  and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features.

  In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but
  a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or
  tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options.

  Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where
  BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers
  with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO
  implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
  was built:

  - For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer
    over-read, leading to a server crash.

  - For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server
    crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution.");
