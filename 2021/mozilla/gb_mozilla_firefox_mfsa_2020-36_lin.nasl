  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"CVE-2020-15664: Attacker-induced prompt for extension installation
By holding a reference to the eval() function from an about:blank window, a malicious webpage could have gained access to the InstallTrigger object which would allow them to prompt the user to install an extension. Combined with user confusion, this could result in an unintended or malicious extension being installed.

CVE-2020-12401: Timing-attack on ECDSA signature generation
During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

CVE-2020-6829: P-384 and P-521 vulnerable to an electro-magnetic side channel attack on signature generation
When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point multiplication algorithm was used, which leaked partial information about the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

CVE-2020-12400: P-384 and P-521 vulnerable to a side channel attack on modular inversion
When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack.

CVE-2020-15665: Address bar not reset when choosing to stay on a page after the beforeunload dialog is shown
Firefox did not reset the address bar after the beforeunload dialog was shown if the user chose to remain on the page. This could have resulted in an incorrect URL being shown when used in conjunction with other unexpected browser behaviors.

CVE-2020-15666: MediaError message property leaks cross-origin response status
When trying to load a non-video in an audio/video context the exact status code (200, 302, 404, 500, 412, 403, etc.) was disclosed via the MediaError Message. This level of information leakage is inconsistent with the standardized onerror/onsuccess disclosure and can lead to inferring login status to services or device discovery on a local network among other attacks.

When processing a MAR update file, after the signature has been validated, an invalid name length could result in ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
