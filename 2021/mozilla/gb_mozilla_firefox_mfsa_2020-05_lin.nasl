A content process could have modified shared memory relating to crash reporting information, crash itself, and cause an out-of-bound write. This could have caused memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2020-6798: Incorrect parsing of template tag could result in JavaScript injection
If a <template> tag was used in a <select%gt, tag, the parser could be confused and allow JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on the browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result.

CVE-2020-6800: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5
Mozilla developers and community members Raul Gurzau, Tyson Smith, Bob Clary, Liz Henry, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 72 and Firefox ESR 68.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2020-6801: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 73
Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Tyson Smith, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 72. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.");
