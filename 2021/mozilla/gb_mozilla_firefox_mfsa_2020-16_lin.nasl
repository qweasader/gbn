A race condition when running shutdown code for Web Worker led to a use-after-free vulnerability. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2020-6831: Buffer overflow in SCTP chunk input validation
A buffer overflow could occur when parsing and validating SCTP chunks in WebRTC. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2020-12390: Incorrect serialization of nsIPrincipal.origin for IPv6 addresses
Incorrect origin serialization of URLs with IPv6 addresses could lead to incorrect security checks

CVE-2020-12391: Content-Security-Policy bypass using object elements
Documents formed using data: URLs in an object element failed to inherit the CSP of the creating context. This allowed the execution of scripts that should have been blocked, albeit with a unique opaque origin.

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP POST data of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as cURL' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in the disclosure of local files.

CVE-2020-12394: URL spoofing in location bar when unfocussed
A logic flaw in our location bar implementation could have allowed a local attacker to spoof the current location by selecting a different origin and removing focus from the input element.

CVE-2020-12395: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 76 and Firefox ESR 68.8
Mozilla developers and community members Alexandru Michis, Jason Kratzer, philipp, Ted Campbell, Bas Schouten, Andre Bargull, and Karl Tomlinson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
