  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"CVE-2021-29960: Filenames printed from private browsing mode incorrectly retained in preferences
Firefox used to cache the last filename used for printing a file. When generating a filename for printing, Firefox usually suggests the web page title.
The caching and suggestion techniques combined may have lead to the title of a website visited during private browsing mode being stored on disk.

CVE-2021-29961: Firefox UI spoof using `<select>` elements and CSS scaling
When styling and rendering an oversized <select> element, Firefox did not apply correct clipping which allowed an attacker to paint over the user interface.

CVE-2021-29959: Devices could be re-enabled without additional permission prompt
When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt.
This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera.

CVE-2021-29967: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 89 and Firefox ESR 78.11
Mozilla developers Christian Holler, Anny Gakhokidze, Alexandru Michis, Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88 and Firefox ESR 78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-29966: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 89
Mozilla developers Christian Holler, Tooru Fujisawa, Tyson Smith reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.");
