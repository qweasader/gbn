  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"CVE-2021-23969: Content Security Policy violation report could have contained the destination of a redirect
As specified in the W3C Content Security Policy draft, when creating a violation report, 'User agents need to ensure that the source file is the URL requested by the page, pre-redirects. If that's not possible, user agents need to strip the URL down to an origin to avoid unintentional leakage.' Under certain types of redirects, Firefox incorrectly set the source file to be the destination of the redirects. This was fixed to be the redirect destination's origin.

CVE-2021-23970: Multithreaded WASM triggered assertions validating separation of script domains
Context-specific code was included in a shared jump table, resulting in assertions being triggered in multithreaded wasm code.

CVE-2021-23968: Content Security Policy violation report could have contained the destination of a redirect
If Content Security Policy blocked frame navigation, the full destination of a redirect served in the frame was reported in the violation report, as opposed to the original frame URI. This could be used to leak sensitive information contained in such URIs.

CVE-2021-23974: noscript elements could have led to an HTML Sanitizer bypass
The DOMParser API did not properly process <noscript> elements for escaping. This could be used as an mXSS vector to bypass an HTML Sanitizer.

CVE-2021-23971: A website's Referrer-Policy could have been be overridden, potentially resulting in the full URL being sent as a Referrer
When processing a redirect with a conflicting Referrer-Policy, Firefox would have adopted the redirect's Referrer-Policy. This would have potentially resulted in more information than intended by the original origin being provided to the destination of the redirect.

CVE-2021-23972: HTTP Auth phishing warning was omitted when a redirect is cached
One phishing tactic on the web is to provide a link with HTTP Auth. For example https://www.phishingtarget.com@evil.com. To mitigate ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
