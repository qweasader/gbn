  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"CVE-2020-16042: Operations on a BigInt could have caused uninitialized memory to be exposed
When a BigInt was right-shifted the backing store was not properly cleared, allowing uninitialized memory to be read.

CVE-2020-26971: Heap buffer overflow in WebGL
Certain blit values provided by the user were not properly constrained leading to a heap buffer overflow on some video drivers.

CVE-2020-26972: Use-After-Free in WebGL
The lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager actors, and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor they have a reference to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.
