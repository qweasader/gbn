  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In the nl80211_policy policy of nl80211.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not required for exploitation.(CVE-2020-27068)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels NFC implementation, A NULL pointer dereference and BUG leading to a denial of service can be triggered by a local unprivileged user causing a kernel panic.(CVE-2021-38208)

A flaw was discovered in processing setsockopt IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE (or IP6T_SO_SET_REPLACE) for 32 bit processes on 64 bit systems. This flaw will allow local user to gain privileges or cause a DoS through user name space. This action is usually restricted to root-privileged users but can also be leveraged if the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_NET_NS and the user is granted elevated privileges.(CVE-2021-22555)

A flaw was found in the 'Routing decision' classifier in the Linux kernel's Traffic Control networking subsystem in the way it handled changing of classification filters, leading to a use-after-free condition. This flaw allows unprivileged local users to escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3715)

In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE: the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case, the length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.(CVE-2021-38160)

An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP) forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.(CVE-2020-26139)

An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 6.1316.1209 for AWUS036H. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary data frames independent of the network configuration.(CVE-2020-26140)

An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 6.1316.1209 for AWUS036H. The Wi-Fi implementation does not verify the Message Integrity Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject and possibly decrypt packets in WPA or WPA2 networks that support the TKIP data-confidentiality protocol.(CVE-2020-26141)

An issue was discovered in the kernel in OpenBSD 6.6. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations treat fragmented frames as full frames. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
