  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.3 when a webcam device exists. video_usercopy in drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c has a memory leak for large arguments, aka CID-fb18802a338b.(CVE-2021-30002)

A flaw was found in the JFS filesystem code. This flaw allows a local attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to panic the system, causing memory corruption or escalating privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-27815)

An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in x25_bind in net/x25/af_x25.c in the Linux kernel. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-35519)

There is a flaw reported in drivers/gpu/drm/ nouveau/ nouveau_sgdma.c in nouveau_sgdma_create_ttm in Nouveau DRM subsystem. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker with a local account with a root privilege, can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.(CVE-2021-20292)

In drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8, the RPA PCI Hotplug driver has a user-tolerable buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, allowing userspace to write data to the kernel stack frame directly. This occurs because add_slot_store and remove_slot_store mishandle drc_name '\0' termination, aka CID-cc7a0bb058b8.(CVE-2021-28972)

A race condition was discovered in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (BUG) because of a lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation, aka CID-dbcc7d57bffc.(CVE-2021-28964)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.7. usbip_sockfd_store in drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status, aka CID-9380afd6df70.(CVE-2021-29265)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A denial of service problem is identified if an extent tree is corrupted in a crafted ext4 filesystem in fs/ext4/extents.c in ext4_es_cache_extent. Fabricating an integer overflow, A local attacker with a special user privilege may cause a system crash problem which can lead to an availability threat.(CVE-2021-3428)

BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel through 5.11.12 have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects arch/x86/ ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
