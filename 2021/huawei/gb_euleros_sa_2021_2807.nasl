NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, a stack buffer overflow can occur when correcting differences in the MFT and MFTMirror allowing for code execution or escalation of privileges when setuid-root.(CVE-2021-35267)

In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute is supplied to the function ntfs_get_attribute_value, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for memory disclosure or denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root cause is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT record : the 'bytes_in_use' field should be less than the 'bytes_allocated' field. When it is not, the parsing of the records proceeds into the wild.(CVE-2021-33285)

In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when specially crafted NTFS attributes are read in the function ntfs_attr_pread_i, a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for writing to arbitrary memory or denial of service of the application.(CVE-2021-33287)

In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted MFT section is supplied in an NTFS image a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for code execution.(CVE-2021-33289)

In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS inode is loaded in the function ntfs_inode_real_open, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for code execution and escalation of privileges.(CVE-2021-35268)

NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute from the MFT is setup in the function ntfs_attr_setup_flag, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for code execution and escalation of privileges.(CVE-2021-35269)

A crafted NTFS image can cause a NULL pointer dereference in ntfs_extent_inode_open in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22(CVE-2021-39251)

A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_ie_lookup in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39252)

A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_runlists_merge_i in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39253)

A crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in memmove, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.(CVE-2021-39254)");
