  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.10.7, insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code can be used by remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gains control over file access because I/O operations are proxied via an attacker-selected backstore.(CVE-2020-28374)

In create_pinctrl of core.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a use after free. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2020-0427)

mwifiex_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/join.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.4 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long SSID value, aka CID-5c455c5ab332.(CVE-2020-36158)

A locking issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c allows a use-after-free attack against TIOCSPGRP, aka CID-54ffccbf053b.(CVE-2020-29661)

A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID, aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24.(CVE-2020-29660)

An issue was discovered in drivers/accessibility/speakup/spk_ttyio.c in the Linux kernel through 5.9.9. Local attackers on systems with the speakup driver could cause a local denial of service attack, aka CID-d41227544427. This occurs because of an invalid free when the line discipline is used more than once.(CVE-2020-28941)

NULL-ptr deref in the spk_ttyio_receive_buf2() function in spk_ttyio.c.(CVE-2020-27830)

In various methods of hid-multitouch.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2020-0465)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of MIDI, where an attacker with a local account and the permissions to issue an ioctl commands to midi devices, could trigger a use-after-free. A write to this specific memory while freed and before use could cause the flow of execution to change and possibly allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation.(CVE-2020-27786)

In the nl80211_policy policy of nl80211.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not required for exploitation.(CVE-2020-27068)
