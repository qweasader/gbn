  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of type confusion) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db.(CVE-2021-33624)

A flaw was found in the CAN BCM networking protocol in the Linux kernel, where a local attacker can abuse a flaw in the CAN subsystem to corrupt memory, crash the system or escalate privileges.(CVE-2021-3609)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's XFRM subsystem when flushing the XFRM tunnel. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2019-25045)

An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the eBPF code verifier in the way a user running the eBPF script uses mod32 destination register truncation when the source register was known to be 0. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3444)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernels Userspace Connection Manager Access for RDMA. This could allow a local attacker to crash the system, corrupt memory or escalate privileges.(CVE-2020-36385)

The canbus filesystem in the Linux kernel contains an information leak of kernel memory to devices on the CAN bus network link layer. An attacker with the ability to dump messages on the CAN bus is able to learn of uninitialized stack values by dumbing messages on the can bus.(CVE-2021-34693)

A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space(CVE-2021-22555)

It was discovered that eBPF 32-bit div/mod source register truncation could lead to out-of-bounds reads and writes in the kernel. It was introduced by commit 68fda450a7df ('bpf: fix 32-bit divide by zero'). It was first introduced in 4.15-rc9, but backported and applied to v4.14.y, v4.9.y and v4.4.y. However, this specific attack will not work on v4.4.y and v4.9.y kernels as pointer arithmetic is prohibited on those kernels. This was introduced by commit f1174f77b50c ('bpf/verifier: rework value tracking'), in v4.14-rc1.(CVE-2021-3600)

In pfkey_dump of af_key.c, there is a possible out-of-bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2021-0605)

An information disclosure flaw exists in the ARM SIGPAGE functionality of the Linux kernel. An attacker with a local account can ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
