A use after free issue exists in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) in GNU Binutils 2.34 in bfd_hash_lookup, as demonstrated in nm-new, that can cause a denial of service via a crafted file.(CVE-2020-16592)

A flaw was found in binutils. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted input file to be processed by binutils could cause usage of uninitialized memory. The highest threat is to application availability with a lower threat to data confidentiality.(CVE-2020-35494)

A flaw was found in Binutils in bfd/pef.c. This flaw allows an attacker who can submit a crafted PEF file to be parsed by objdump to cause a heap buffer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-35493)
