A flaw was found in pki-core. A specially crafted POST request can be used to reflect a DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to inject code into the search query form which can get automatically executed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.(CVE-2020-25715)

A Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in all pki-core 10.x.x versions, where the pki-ca module from the pki-core server.
