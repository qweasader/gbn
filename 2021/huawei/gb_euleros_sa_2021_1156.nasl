There's a flaw in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c of openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0. If an attacker is able to provide untrusted input to openjpeg's conversion/encoding functionality, they could cause an out-of-bounds read. The highest impact of this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2020-27845)

A heap-buffer overflow was found in the way openjpeg2 handled certain PNG format files. An attacker could use this flaw to cause an application crash or in some cases execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running such an application.(CVE-2020-27814)

A flaw was found in OpenJPEG's encoder. This flaw allows an attacker to pass specially crafted x,y offset input to OpenJPEG to use during encoding. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-27823)");
