  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there are multiple heap use after free vulnerabilities in the tool nasm. The related heap is allocated in the token() function and freed in the detoken() function (called by pp_getline()) - it is used again at multiple positions later that could cause multiple damages. For example, it causes a corrupted double-linked list in detoken(), a double free or corruption in delete_Token(), and an out-of-bounds write in detoken(). It has a high possibility to lead to a remote code execution attack.(CVE-2017-10686)

In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, preproc.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.(CVE-2017-11111)

In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a 'SEGV on unknown address' that will cause a remote denial of service attack, because asm/preproc.c mishandles macro calls that have the wrong number of arguments.(CVE-2017-17810)

In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the function detoken() in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial of service attack.(CVE-2017-17812)

In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is an illegal address access in is_mmacro() in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial of service attack, because of a missing check for the relationship between minimum and maximum parameter counts.(CVE-2017-17815)

In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there is an illegal address access in the function find_cc() in asm/preproc.c that will cause a remote denial of service attack, because pointers associated with skip_white_ calls are not validated.(CVE-2017-17819)

Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.13.02rc2 has a heap-based buffer over-read in the function tokenize in asm/preproc.c, related to an unterminated string.(CVE-2018-8881)

Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.13.02rc2 has a stack-based buffer under-read in the function ieee_shr in asm/float.c via a large shift value.(CVE-2018-8882)

Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0 has a division-by-zero vulnerability in the expr5 function in asm/eval.c via a malformed input file.(CVE-2018-10016)

Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0 has an endless while loop in the assemble_file function of asm/nasm.c because of a globallineno integer overflow.(CVE-2018-10316)

Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc15 has a heap-based buffer over-read in expand_mmac_params in asm/preproc.c for insufficient input.(CVE-2018-19214)

Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc16 has a heap-based buffer over-read in expand_mmac_params in asm/preproc.c for the special cases of the % and $ and ! characters.(CVE-2018-19215)

There is an illegal address access at asm/preproc.c (function: is_mmacro) in Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc16 that will cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) because a certain conversion can result in a negative ...
