  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free was found in the way the console subsystem was using ioctls KDGKBSENT and KDSKBSENT. A local user could use this flaw to get read memory access out of bounds. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2020-25656)

The time subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.9.9, when CONFIG_TIMER_STATS is enabled, allows local users to discover real PID values (as distinguished from PID values inside a PID namespace) by reading the /proc/timer_list file, related to the print_timer function in kernel/time/timer_list.c and the __timer_stats_timer_set_start_info function in kernel/time/timer.c.(CVE-2017-5967)

A flaw in the way reply ICMP packets are limited in the Linux kernel functionality was found that allows to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypassing source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well. Kernel versions before 5.10 may be vulnerable to this issue.(CVE-2020-25705)

In cdev_get of char_dev.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10Android ID: A-153467744(CVE-2020-0305)

In create_pinctrl of core.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a use after free. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-140550171(CVE-2020-0427)

A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.(CVE-2020-2732)

In uvc_scan_chain_forward of uvc_driver.c, there is a possible linked list corruption due to an unusual root cause. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-111893654References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2020-0404)

A stack information leak flaw was found in s390/s390x in the Linux kernel's memory manager functionality, where it incorrectly writes to the /proc/sys/vm/cmm_timeout file. This flaw allows a local user to see the kernel data.(CVE-2020-10773)

Improper access control in BlueZ may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via adjacent access.(CVE-2020-12352)
