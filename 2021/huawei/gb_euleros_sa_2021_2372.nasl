  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The PS Interpreter in Ghostscript 9.18 and 9.20 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted userparams.(CVE-2016-7976)

ghostscript before version 9.21 is vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow that was found in the ghostscript jbig2_decode_gray_scale_image function which is used to decode halftone segments in a JBIG2 image. A document (PostScript or PDF) with an embedded, specially crafted, jbig2 image could trigger a segmentation fault in ghostscript.(CVE-2016-9601)

Artifex jbig2dec 0.13 allows out-of-bounds writes and reads because of an integer overflow in the jbig2_image_compose function in jbig2_image.c during operations on a crafted .jb2 file, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or disclosure of sensitive information from process memory.(CVE-2017-7976)

The Ins_MDRP function in base/ttinterp.c in Artifex Ghostscript GhostXPS 9.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted document.(CVE-2017-9726)

The gx_ttfReader__Read function in base/gxttfb.c in Artifex Ghostscript GhostXPS 9.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted document.(CVE-2017-9727)

The Ins_JMPR function in base/ttinterp.c in Artifex Ghostscript GhostXPS 9.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted document.(CVE-2017-9739)

The Ins_IP function in base/ttinterp.c in Artifex Ghostscript GhostXPS 9.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted document.(CVE-2017-9612)

libjbig2dec.a in Artifex jbig2dec 0.13, as used in MuPDF and Ghostscript, has a NULL pointer dereference in the jbig2_huffman_get function in jbig2_huffman.c. For example, the jbig2dec utility will crash (segmentation fault) when parsing an invalid file.(CVE-2017-9216)");
