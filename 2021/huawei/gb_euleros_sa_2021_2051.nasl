  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the Nosy driver in the Linux kernel. This issue allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3483)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.3 when a webcam device exists. video_usercopy in drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c has a memory leak for large arguments, aka CID-fb18802a338b.(CVE-2021-30002)

An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as CVE-2021-28950.(CVE-2020-36322)

There is a flaw reported in drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nouveau_sgdma.c in nouveau_sgdma_create_ttm in Nouveau DRM subsystem. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker with a local account with a root privilege, can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.(CVE-2021-20292)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.8. arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c allows a set_memory_region_test infinite loop for certain nested page faults, aka CID-e72436bc3a52.(CVE-2020-36310)

A race condition was found in the Linux kernel in sctp_destroy_sock. If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock held and sp->do_auto_asconf is true, then an element is removed from the auto_asconf_splist without any proper locking. This can lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of a network service or from an unprivileged process if certain conditions are met.(CVE-2021-23133)

In intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8 on some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled, aka CID-d88d05a9e0b6.(CVE-2021-28971)

BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel through 5.11.12 have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c.(CVE-2021-29154)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a partially uninitialized data structure, aka CID-50535249f624.(CVE-2021-29647)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7. The KVM subsystem allows out-of-range access to memslots after a deletion, aka CID-0774a964ef56. This affects arch/s390/kvm/kvm-s390.c, ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
