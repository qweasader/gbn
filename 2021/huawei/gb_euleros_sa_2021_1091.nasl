It was discovered that websockets.c in LibVNCServer prior to 0.9.12 did not properly decode certain WebSocket frames. A malicious attacker could exploit this by sending specially crafted WebSocket frames to a server, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.(CVE-2017-18922)

LibVNC commit before d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a contains a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which allow an attacker to read stack memory and can be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it can be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity. These vulnerabilities have been fixed in commit d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a.(CVE-2019-15681)

A divide by zero issue was found to occur in libvncserver-0.9.12. A malicious client could use this flaw to send a specially crafted message that, when processed by the VNC server, would lead to a floating point exception, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2020-25708)");
