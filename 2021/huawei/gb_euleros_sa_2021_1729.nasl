  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"libImaging/FliDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has an FLI buffer overflow.(CVE-2020-5313)

An out-of-bounds write flaw was discovered in python-pillow in the way SGI RLE images are decoded. An application that uses python-pillow to decode untrusted images may be vulnerable to this flaw, which can allow an attacker to crash the application or potentially execute code on the system.(CVE-2020-5311)

libImaging/PcxDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has a PCX P mode buffer overflow.(CVE-2020-5312)

In libImaging/SgiRleDecode.c in Pillow through 7.0.0, a number of out-of-bounds reads exist in the parsing of SGI image files, a different issue than CVE-2020-5311.(CVE-2020-11538)

In libImaging/Jpeg2KDecode.c in Pillow before 7.1.0, there are multiple out-of-bounds reads via a crafted JP2 file.(CVE-2020-10994)

In libImaging/PcxDecode.c in Pillow before 7.1.0, an out-of-bounds read can occur when reading PCX files where state->shuffle is instructed to read beyond state->buffer.(CVE-2020-10378)

Pillow before 7.1.0 has multiple out-of-bounds reads in libImaging/FliDecode.c.(CVE-2020-10177)

libImaging/TiffDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has a TIFF decoding integer overflow, related to realloc.(CVE-2020-5310)

In Pillow before 7.1.0, there are two Buffer Overflows in libImaging/TiffDecode.c.(CVE-2020-10379)

There is a DoS vulnerability in Pillow before 6.2.2 caused by FpxImagePlugin.py calling the range function on an unvalidated 32-bit integer if the number of bands is large. On Windows running 32-bit Python, this results in an OverflowError or MemoryError due to the 2 GB limit. However, on Linux running 64-bit Python this results in the process being terminated by the OOM killer.(CVE-2019-19911)

** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.(CVE-2020-19911)

In Pillow before 8.1.0, PcxDecode has a buffer over-read when decoding a crafted PCX file because the user-supplied stride value is trusted for buffer calculations.(CVE-2020-35653)");
