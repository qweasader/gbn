  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel where refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind() causing use-after-free which might lead to privilege escalations.(CVE-2020-25670)

A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel, where a refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect() causing use-after-free which might lead to privilege escalations.(CVE-2020-25671)

In the Linux kernel before 5.4.16, a race condition in tty->disc_data handling in the slip and slcan line discipline could lead to a use-after-free, aka CID-0ace17d56824. This affects drivers/net/slip/slip.c and drivers/net/can/slcan.c.(CVE-2020-14416)

An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as CVE-2021-28950.(CVE-2020-36322)

In drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.10.7, insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code can be used by remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gains control over file access because I/O operations are proxied via an attacker-selected backstore.(CVE-2020-28374)

The Linux kernel before 5.11.14 has a use-after-free in cipso_v4_genopt in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c because the CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting for the DOI definitions is mishandled, aka CID-ad5d07f4a9cd. This leads to writing an arbitrary value.(CVE-2021-33033)

Use After Free vulnerability in nfc sockets in the Linux Kernel before 5.12.4 allows local attackers to elevate their privileges. In typical configurations, the issue can only be triggered by a privileged local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability.(CVE-2021-23134)

An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in list_devices in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Multi-device driver module in the Linux kernel before 5.12. A bound check failure allows an attacker with special user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) privilege to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-31916)

net/bluetooth/hci_request.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.2 has a race condition for removal of the HCI controller.(CVE-2021-32399)

A flaw use-after-free in the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user detaches bluetooth dongle or other way triggers unregister bluetooth device event. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2021-3573)");
