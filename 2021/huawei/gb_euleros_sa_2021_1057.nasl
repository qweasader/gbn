  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Quick Emulator (Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper access control issue. It could occur while accessing virtfs metadata files in mapped-file security mode. A guest user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges inside guest.(CVE-2017-7493)

qemu-bridge-helper.c in QEMU 4.0.0 does not ensure that a network interface name (obtained from bridge.conf or a --br=bridge option) is limited to the IFNAMSIZ size, which can lead to an ACL bypass.(CVE-2019-13164)

Qemu has a Buffer Overflow in pcnet_receive in hw/net/pcnet.c because an incorrect integer data type is used.(CVE-2018-17962)

Buffer overflow in the 'megasas_mmio_write' function in Qemu 2.9.0 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors.(CVE-2017-8380)

qemu_deliver_packet_iov in net/net.c in Qemu accepts packet sizes greater than INT_MAX, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact.(CVE-2018-17963)

In QEMU 3.1.0, load_device_tree in device_tree.c calls the deprecated load_image function, which has a buffer overflow risk.(CVE-2018-20815)

interface_release_resource in hw/display/qxl.c in QEMU 4.0.0 has a NULL pointer dereference.(CVE-2019-12155)

An issue was discovered in ide_dma_cb() in hw/ide/core.c in QEMU 2.4.0 through 4.2.0. The guest system can crash the QEMU process in the host system via a special SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND. It hits an assertion that implies that the size of successful DMA transfers there must be a multiple of 512 (the size of a sector). NOTE: a member of the QEMU security team disputes the significance of this issue because a 'privileged guest user has many ways to cause similar DoS effect, without triggering this assert.'(CVE-2019-20175)

Use-after-free vulnerability in the sofree function in slirp/socket.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows attackers to cause a denial of service (QEMU instance crash) by leveraging failure to properly clear ifq_so from pending packets.(CVE-2017-13711)

Qemu has a Buffer Overflow in rtl8139_do_receive in hw/net/rtl8139.c because an incorrect integer data type is used.(CVE-2018-17958)

ip_reass in ip_input.c in libslirp 4.0.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a large packet because it mishandles a case involving the first fragment.(CVE-2019-14378)

m_cat in slirp/mbuf.c in Qemu has a heap-based buffer overflow via incoming fragmented datagrams.(CVE-2018-11806)

Memory leak in the audio/audio.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by repeatedly starting and stopping audio capture.(CVE-2017-8309)

Memory leak in the keyboard input event handlers support in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (host memory consumption) by rapidly generating large keyboard ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
