The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-27823)

A flaw was found in OpenJPEG's encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-27824)

jp2/opj_decompress.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a use-after-free that can be triggered if there is a mix of valid and invalid files in a directory operated on by the decompressor. Triggering a double-free may also be possible. This is related to calling opj_image_destroy twice.(CVE-2020-15389)

A flaw was found in OpenJPEG in versions prior to 2.4.0. This flaw allows an attacker to provide specially crafted input to the conversion or encoding functionality, causing an out-of-bounds read. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.(CVE-2020-27843)

A heap-buffer overflow was found in the way openjpeg2 handled certain PNG format files. An attacker could use this flaw to cause an application crash or in some cases execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running such an application.(CVE-2020-27814)

There's a flaw in openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0 in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c. When an attacker is able to provide crafted input to be processed by the openjpeg encoder, this could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest impact from this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2020-27841)

There's a flaw in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c of openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0. If an attacker is able to provide untrusted input to openjpeg's conversion/encoding functionality, they could cause an out-of-bounds read. The highest impact of this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2020-27845)");
