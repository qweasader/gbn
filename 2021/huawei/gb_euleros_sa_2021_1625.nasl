  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in samba's DNS server. An authenticated user could use this flaw to the RPC server to crash. This RPC server, which also serves protocols other than dnsserver, will be restarted after a short delay, but it is easy for an authenticated non administrative attacker to crash it again as soon as it returns. The Samba DNS server itself will continue to operate, but many RPC services will not.(CVE-2020-14383)

A flaw was found in the way samba handled file and directory permissions. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain access to certain file and directory information which otherwise would be unavailable to the attacker.(CVE-2020-14318)

A null pointer dereference flaw was found in samba's Winbind service in versions before 4.11.15, before 4.12.9 and before 4.13.1. A local user could use this flaw to crash the winbind service causing denial of service.(CVE-2020-14323)

A flaw was found in the AD DC NBT server in all Samba versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11 and before 4.12.4. A samba user could send an empty UDP packet to cause the samba server to crash.(CVE-2020-14303)

A flaw was found in all Samba versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11 and before 4.12.4 in the way it processed NetBios over TCP/IP. This flaw allows a remote attacker could to cause the Samba server to consume excessive CPU use, resulting in a denial of service. This highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-10745)

A use-after-free flaw was found in all samba LDAP server versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11, before 4.12.4 used in a AC DC configuration. A Samba LDAP user could use this flaw to crash samba.(CVE-2020-10760)

A NULL pointer dereference, or possible use-after-free flaw was found in Samba AD LDAP server in versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11 and before 4.12.4. Although some versions of Samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not support Samba in AD mode, the affected code is shipped with the libldb package. This flaw allows an authenticated user to possibly trigger a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-10730)

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC), aka 'Netlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.(CVE-2020-1472)");
