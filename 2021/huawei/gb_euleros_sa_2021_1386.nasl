  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID, aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24.(CVE-2020-29660)

A locking vulnerability was found in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel in drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c. This flaw allows a local attacker to possibly corrupt memory or escalate privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-29661)


The Linux kernel is the kernel used by the open source operating system Linux released by the Linux Foundation. The Linux kernel con_font_op() has a code problem vulnerability, which can force the use of freed memory, resulting in denial of service or execution of custom code.(CVE-2020-25668 CVE-2020-4788 CVE-2020-27830)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of MIDI, where an attacker with a local account and the permissions to issue ioctl commands to midi devices could trigger a use-after-free issue. A write to this specific memory while freed and before use causes the flow of execution to change and possibly allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system (CVE-2020-27786)

In various methods of hid-multitouch.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-162844689References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2020-0465)

In the nl80211_policy policy of nl80211.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not required for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-119770583(CVE-2020-27068)

In do_epoll_ctl and ep_loop_check_proc of eventpoll.c, there is a possible use after free due to a logic error. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-147802478References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2020-0466)

In audit_free_lsm_field of auditfilter.c, there is a possible bad kfree due to a logic error in audit_data_to_entry. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.
