  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in x25_bind in net/x25/af_x25.c in the Linux kernel. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-35519)

A flaw was found in the Nosy driver in the Linux kernel. This issue allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3483)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-f232326f6966. This affects pointer types that do not define a ptr_limit.(CVE-2020-27170)

A race condition was discovered in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (BUG) because of a lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation, aka CID-dbcc7d57bffc.(CVE-2021-28964)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d.(CVE-2020-27171)

rtw_wx_set_scan in drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/os_dep/ioctl_linux.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.6 allows writing beyond the end of the ->ssid[] array. NOTE: from the perspective of kernel.org releases, CVE IDs are not normally used for drivers/staging/* (unfinished work), however, system integrators may have situations in which a drivers/staging issue is relevant to their own customer base.(CVE-2021-28660)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.3 when a webcam device exists. video_usercopy in drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c has a memory leak for large arguments, aka CID-fb18802a338b.(CVE-2021-30002)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The netfilter subsystem allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because net/netfilter/x_tables.c and include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h lack a full memory barrier upon the assignment of a new table value, aka CID-175e476b8cdf.(CVE-2021-29650)

BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel through 5.11.12 have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
