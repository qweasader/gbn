  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of string matching within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) when inserting iptables rules could insert a rule which can panic the system.(CVE-2021-20177)

rtw_wx_set_scan in drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/os_dep/ioctl_linux.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.6 allows writing beyond the end of the ->ssid[] array. NOTE: from the perspective of kernel.org releases, CVE IDs are not normally used for drivers/staging/* (unfinished work), however, system integrators may have situations in which a drivers/staging issue is relevant to their own customer base.(CVE-2021-28660)

There is a flaw reported in drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nouveau_sgdma.c in nouveau_sgdma_create_ttm in Nouveau DRM subsystem. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker with a local account with a root privilege, can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.(CVE-2021-20292)

ntfs_read_locked_inode in the ntfs.ko filesystem driver in the Linux kernel 4.15.0 allows attackers to trigger a use-after-free read and possibly cause a denial of service (kernel oops or panic) via a crafted ntfs filesystem.(CVE-2018-12929)

In the Linux kernel 4.15.0, a NULL pointer dereference was discovered in hfs_ext_read_extent in hfs.ko. This can occur during a mount of a crafted hfs filesystem.(CVE-2018-12928)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. A kernel pointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transport structure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem, the transport's handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfs file system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. When read, the show_transport_handle function (in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle. This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in the kernel module's global variables.(CVE-2021-27363)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c is adversely affected by the ability of an unprivileged user to craft Netlink messages.(CVE-2021-27364)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. Certain iSCSI data structures do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. An unprivileged user can send a Netlink message that is associated with iSCSI, and has a length up to the maximum length of a Netlink message.(CVE-2021-27365)

nbd_add_socket in drivers/block/nbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.12 has an ndb_queue_rq use-after-free that could be triggered by local attackers (with access to the nbd device) via an I/O request at a certain point during device setup, aka CID-b98e762e3d71.(CVE-2021-3348)
