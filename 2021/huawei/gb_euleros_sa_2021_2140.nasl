  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A memory leak in the ath10k_usb_hif_tx_sg() function in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering usb_submit_urb() failures, aka CID-b8d17e7d93d2.(CVE-2019-19078)

In the Linux kernel before 5.6.1, drivers/media/usb/gspca/xirlink_cit.c (aka the Xirlink camera USB driver) mishandles invalid descriptors, aka CID-a246b4d54770.(CVE-2020-11668)

An issue was found in Linux kernel before 5.5.4. mwifiex_ret_wmm_get_status() in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/wmm.c allows a remote AP to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow because of an incorrect memcpy, aka CID-3a9b153c5591.(CVE-2020-12654)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking subsystem handled the write queue between TCP disconnection and re-connections. A local attacker could use this flaw to trigger multiple use-after-free conditions potentially escalating their privileges on the system.(CVE-2019-15239)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's filesystem subsystem handled a race condition in the chrdev_open function. This flaw allows a privileged local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service or potentially escalating their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-0305)

A flaw was found in the Linux pinctrl system. It is possible to trigger an of bounds read due to a use after free. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.(CVE-2020-0427)

A stack information leak flaw was found in s390/s390x in the Linux kernel's memory manager functionality, where it incorrectly writes to the /proc/sys/vm/cmm_timeout file. This flaw allows a local user to see the kernel data.(CVE-2020-10773)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the invert video code on VGA consoles when a local attacker attempts to resize the console, calling an ioctl VT_RESIZE, which causes an out-of-bounds write to occur. This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-14331)
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free memory flaw was found in the perf subsystem allowing a local attacker with permission to monitor perf events to corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-14351)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
