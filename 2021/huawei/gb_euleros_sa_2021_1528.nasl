A complete lack of validation of attacker-controlled parameters can lead to a buffer over read. The results of the over read are then written back to the guest virtual machine memory. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker in a virtual machine to read significant amounts of host memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and system availability.(CVE-2020-14377)

A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A lack of bounds checking when copying iv_data from the VM guest memory into host memory can lead to a large buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-14376)

A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A flawed bounds checking in the copy_data function leads to a buffer overflow allowing an attacker in a virtual machine to write arbitrary data to any address in the vhost_crypto application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-14374)

A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. Virtio ring descriptors, and the data they describe are in a region of memory accessible by from both the virtual machine and the host. An attacker in a VM can change the contents of the memory after vhost_crypto has validated it. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.CVE-2020-14375)");
