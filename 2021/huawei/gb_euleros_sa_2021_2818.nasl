  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_standalone.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.2 allows observation of changes in any net namespace because these changes are leaked into all other net namespaces. This is related to the NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX, NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX, and NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS sysctls.(CVE-2021-38209)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10. drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c has a use-after-free because the ctx is reached via the ctx_list in some ucma_migrate_id situations where ucma_close is called, aka CID-f5449e74802c.(CVE-2020-36385)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.19. The XFRM subsystem has a use-after-free, related to an xfrm_state_fini panic, aka CID-dbb2483b2a46.(CVE-2019-25045)

A flaw was found in the CAN BCM networking protocol in the Linux kernel, where a local attacker can abuse a flaw in the CAN subsystem to corrupt memory, crash the system or escalate privileges.(CVE-2021-3609)

A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.(CVE-2021-3679)

arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_rtas.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.5 on the powerpc platform allows KVM guest OS users to cause host OS memory corruption via rtas_args.nargs, aka CID-f62f3c20647e.(CVE-2021-37576)

** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE: the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case, the length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.(CVE-2021-38160)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's eBPF verification code, where the eBPF 32-bit div/mod source register truncation could lead to out-of-bounds reads and writes. By default, accessing the eBPF verifier is only possible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. This flaw allows a local user who can run eBPF instructions to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3600)

In kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of type confusion) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db.(CVE-2021-33624)

net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.10 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory because parts of a data structure are uninitialized.(CVE-2021-34693)
