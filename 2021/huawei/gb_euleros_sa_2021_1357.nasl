  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in Samba, all versions starting samba 4.5.0 before samba 4.9.15, samba 4.10.10, samba 4.11.2, in the way it handles a user password change or a new password for a samba user. The Samba Active Directory Domain Controller can be configured to use a custom script to check for password complexity. This configuration can fail to verify password complexity when non-ASCII characters are used in the password, which could lead to weak passwords being set for samba users, making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks.(CVE-2019-14833)

A flaw was found in samba 4.0.0 before samba 4.9.15 and samba 4.10.x before 4.10.10. An attacker can crash AD DC LDAP server via dirsync resulting in denial of service. Privilege escalation is not possible with this issue.(CVE-2019-14847)

A use-after-free flaw was found in all samba LDAP server versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11, before 4.12.4 used in a AC DC configuration. A Samba LDAP user could use this flaw to crash samba.(CVE-2020-10760)

Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code, it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.(CVE-2017-11103)

A flaw was found in samba's DNS server. An authenticated user could use this flaw to the RPC server to crash. This RPC server, which also serves protocols other than dnsserver, will be restarted after a short delay, but it is easy for an authenticated non administrative attacker to crash it again as soon as it returns. The Samba DNS server itself will continue to operate, but many RPC services will not.(CVE-2020-14383)

A flaw was found in the way samba handled file and directory permissions. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain access to certain file and directory information which otherwise would be unavailable to the attacker.(CVE-2020-14318)

A null pointer dereference flaw was found in samba's Winbind service in versions before 4.11.15, before 4.12.9 and before 4.13.1. A local user could use this flaw to crash the winbind service causing denial of service.(CVE-2020-14323)");
