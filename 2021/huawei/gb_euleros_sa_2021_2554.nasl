This could lead to local information disclosure in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2021-0605)

A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/ netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space(CVE-2021-22555)

A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel where non-blocking socket in llcp_sock_connect() leads to leak and eventually hanging-up the system.(CVE-2020-25673)

The vgacon subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.8.10 mishandles software scrollback. There is a vgacon_scrolldelta out-of-bounds read, aka CID-973c096f6a85.(CVE-2020-28097)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's eBPF verification code, where the eBPF 32-bit div/mod source register truncation could lead to out-of-bounds reads and writes. By default, accessing the eBPF verifier is only accessible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. This flaw allows a local user who can run eBPF instructions to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3600)

The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.(CVE-2020-24586)

The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.(CVE-2020-24588)

The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.(CVE-2020-24587)

In kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of type confusion) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db.(CVE-2021-33624)

net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.10 allows local users to obtain sensitive information ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
