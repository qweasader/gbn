     Update to version 3.0.32:

  - Security/Reliability (boo#1183129)

  - ssplit(): Remove an assertion that could be triggered with a crafted
           CGI request. Commit 2256d7b4d67. OVE-20210203-0001. CVE-2021-20272
           Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)

  - cgi_send_banner(): Overrule invalid image types. Prevents a crash
           with a crafted CGI request if Privoxy is toggled off. Commit
           e711c505c48. OVE-20210206-0001. CVE-2021-20273 Reported by: Joshua
           Rogers (Opera)

  - socks5_connect(): Don&#x27 t try to send credentials when none are
           configured. Fixes a crash due to a NULL-pointer dereference when the
           socks server misbehaves. Commit 85817cc55b9. OVE-20210207-0001.
           CVE-2021-20274 Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)

  - chunked_body_is_complete(): Prevent an invalid read of size two.
           Commit a912ba7bc9c. OVE-20210205-0001. CVE-2021-20275 Reported by:
           Joshua Rogers (Opera)

  - Obsolete pcre: Prevent invalid memory accesses with an invalid
           pattern passed to pcre_compile(). Note that the obsolete pcre code
           is scheduled to be removed before the 3.0.33 release. There has been
           a warning since 2008 already. Commit 28512e5b624. OVE-20210222-0001.
           CVE-2021-20276 Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)

  - Bug fixes:

  - Properly parse the client-tag-lifetime directive. Previously it was
           not accepted as an obsolete hash value was being used. Reported by:
           Joshua Rogers (Opera)

  - decompress_iob(): Prevent reading of uninitialized data. Reported
           by: Joshua Rogers (Opera).

  - decompress_iob(): Don&#x27 t advance cur past eod when looking for the
           end of the file name and comment.

  - decompress_iob(): Cast value to unsigned char before shifting.
           Prevents a left-shift of a negative value which is undefined
           behaviour. Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)

  - buf_copy(): Fail if there&#x27 s no data to write or nothing to do.
           Prevents undefined behaviour 'applying zero offset to null pointer'.
           Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)

  - log_error(): Treat LOG_LEVEL_FATAL as fatal even when --stfu is
           being used while fuzzing. Reported by: Jos ...
