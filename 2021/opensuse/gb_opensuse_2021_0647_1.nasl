  - Update to 1.29.3 Release v1.29.3 is a patch release to improve the
       stability of the Netdata Agent. We discovered a bug that when
       proc.plugin attempts to collect the
     operstate parameter for a virtual network interface. If the chart is
      obsoleted, the Netdata Agent crashes. This release also contains
      additional bug fixes and improvements. Bug fixes

  * Fix proc.plugin to invalidate RRDSETVAR pointers on obsoletion.

  - Update to 1.29.2 Release v1.29.2 is a patch release to improve the
       stability of the Netdata Agent. We discovered that an improvement
       introduced in v1.29.0 could inadvertently set all os_* host labels to
       unknown, which could affect users who leverage these host labels to
       organize their nodes, deploy health entities, or export metrics to
       external time-series databases. This bug has been fixed. This release
       also contains additional bug fixes and improvements. Improvements

  * Make the Opsgenie API URL configurable.

  * Add k8s_cluster_id host label.

  * Enable apps.plugin aggregation debug messages.

  * Add configuration parameter to disable stock alarms.

  * Add ACLK proxy setting as host label.

  * Add freeswitch to apps_groups.conf.

  * Simplify thread creation and remove unnecessary variables in the eBPF
         plugin. Bug fixes

  * Fix the context filtering on the data query endpoint.

  * Fix container/host detection in the system-info.sh script.

  * Add a small delay to the ipv4_tcp_resets alarms.

  * Fix collecting operstate for virtual network interfaces.

  * Fix sendmail unrecognized option F error.

  * Fix so that raw binary data should never be printed.

  * Change KSM memory chart type to stacked.

  * Allow the REMOVED alarm status via ACLK if the previous status was
         WARN/CRIT.

  * Reduce excessive logging in the ACLK.

  - Changes in 1.29.1 Release v1.29.1 is a hotfix release to address a crash
       in the Netdata Agent. A locking bug in one of the internal collectors in
       Netdata could cause it to crash during shutdown in a way that would
       result in the Netdata Agent taking an excessively long time to exit. Bug
       fixes

  * Fix crash during shutdown of cgroups internal plugin.

  - Update to 1.29.0 (go.d.plugin 0.27.0) The v1.29.0 release of the Netdata
       Agent is a maintenance release that brings incremental but necessary
       improvements that make your monitoring experience more robust. We&#x27 ve ...
