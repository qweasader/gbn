     ssh-audit was updated to version 2.5.0

  * Fixed crash when running host key tests.

  * Handles server connection failures more gracefully.

  * Now prints JSON with indents when -jj is used (useful for debugging).

  * Added MD5 fingerprints to verbose output.

  * Added -d/--debug option for getting debugging output.

  * Updated JSON output to include MD5 fingerprints. Note that this results
       in a breaking change in the &#x27 fingerprints&#x27  dictionary format.

  * Updated OpenSSH 8.1 (and earlier) policies to include rsa-sha2-512 and
       rsa-sha2-256.

  * Added OpenSSH v8.6 &amp  v8.7 policies.

  * Added 3 new key exchanges:

       + gss-gex-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==
       + gss-group1-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==
       + gss-group14-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==

  * Added 3 new MACs:

       + hmac-ripemd160-96
       + AEAD_AES_128_GCM
       + AEAD_AES_256_GCM

     Update to version 2.4.0

  * Added multi-threaded scanning support.

  * Added version check for OpenSSH user enumeration (CVE-2018-15473).

  * Added deprecation note to host key types based on SHA-1.

  * Added extra warnings for SSHv1.

  * Added built-in hardened OpenSSH v8.5 policy.

  * Upgraded warnings to failures for host key types based on SHA-1

  * Fixed crash when receiving unexpected response during host key test.

  * Fixed hang against older Cisco devices during host key test &amp  gex test.

  * Fixed improper termination while scanning multiple targets when
       one target returns an error.

  * Dropped support for Python 3.5 (which reached EOL in Sept.2020)

  * Added 1 new key exchange: sntrup761x25519-sha512(a)openssh.com.

     Update to version 2.3.1

  * Now parses public key sizes for rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01(a)openssh.com and
       rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01(a)openssh.com host key types.

  * Flag ssh-rsa-cert-v01(a)openssh.com as a failure due to SHA-1 hash.

  * Fixed bug in recommendation output which suppressed some algorithms
       inappropriately.

  * Built-in policies now include CA key requirements (if certificates are
       in use).

  * Lookup function (--lookup) now performs case-insensitive lookups of
       similar algorithms.

  * Migrated pre-made policies from external files to internal database.

  * Split single 3,500 line script into many files (by class).

  * Added setup.py support

  * Added 1 new cipher: des-cbc(a)ssh.com.

     Update to version 2.3.0

     The highlight of this release is support for policy scanning (th ...
