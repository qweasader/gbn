  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for alpine fixes the following issues:

     Update to release 2.24

  * A few crash fixes

  * Implementation of XOAUTH2 for Yahoo! Mail.

     Update to release 2.23.2

  * Expansion of the configuration screen for XOAUTH2 to include username,
       and tenant.

  * Alpine uses the domain in the From: header of a message to generate a
       message-id and suppresses all information about Alpine, version,
       revision, and time of generation
       of the message-id from this header.

  * Alpine does not generate Sender or X-X-Sender by default by enabling [X]
       Disable Sender as the default.

  * Alpine does not disclose User Agent by default by enabling [X] Suppress
       User Agent by default.

  * When messages are selected, pressing the &#x27  &#x27  command to broaden or
       narrow a search, now offers the possibility to completely replace the
       search, and is almost equivalent to being a shortcut to 'unselect all
       messages, and select again'.

     Update to release 2.23

  * Fixes boo#1173281, CVE-2020-14929: Alpine silently proceeds to use an
       insecure connection after a /tls is sent in certain circumstances.

  * Implementation of XOAUTH2 authentication support for Outlook.

  * Add support for the OAUTHBEARER authentication method in Gmail.

  * Support for the SASL-IR IMAP extension.

  * Alpine can pass an HTML message to an external web browser, by using the
       'External' command in the ATTACHMENT INDEX screen.

     Update to release 2.22

  * Support for XOAUTH2 authentication method in Gmail.

  * NTLM authentication support with the ntlm library.

  * Added the '/tls1_3' flag for servers that support it.

  * Add the 'g' option to the select command that works in IMAP servers that
       implement the X-GM-EXT-1 capability (such as the
       one offered by Gmail).

  * Added '/auth=XYZ' to the way to define a server. This allows users to
       select the method to authenticate to an IMAP, SMTP
       or POP3 server. Examples are /auth=plain, or /auth=gssapi, etc.

  * When a message is of type multipart/mixed, and its first part is
       multipart/signed, Alpine will include the text of the
       original message in a reply message, instead of including a multipart
        attachment.

  * Added backward search in the index screen.

  * pico: Add -dict option to Pico, which allows users to choose a
       dictionary when spelling.

  - Drop /usr/bin/mailutil, it is not built by default anymore.

  * Added Quota subcommands for printing, forwarding, saving, etc.");
