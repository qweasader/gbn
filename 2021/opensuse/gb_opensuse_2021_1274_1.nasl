  - CVE-2021-32749: prevent a command injection via mail command
       (boo#1188610)

  - Integrate change to resolve boo#1146856 and boo#1180738

     Update to 0.11.2

  - increased stability, filter and action updates

     New Features and Enhancements

  * fail2ban-regex:

  - speedup formatted output (bypass unneeded stats creation)

  - extended with prefregex statistic

  - more informative output for `datepattern` (e. g. set from filter) -
         pattern : description

  * parsing of action in jail-configs considers space between action-names
       as separator also (previously only new-line was allowed), for example
       `action = a b` would specify 2 actions `a` and `b`

  * new filter and jail for GitLab recognizing failed application logins
       (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2689)

  * new filter and jail for Grafana recognizing failed application logins
       (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2855)

  * new filter and jail for SoftEtherVPN recognizing failed application
       logins (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2723)

  * `filter.d/guacamole.conf` extended with `logging` parameter to follow
       webapp-logging if it&#x27 s configured (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2631)

  * `filter.d/bitwarden.conf` enhanced to support syslog
       (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2778)

  * introduced new prefix `{UNB}` for `datepattern` to disable word
       boundaries in regex

  * datetemplate: improved anchor detection for capturing groups `(^...)`

  * datepattern: improved handling with wrong recognized timestamps
       (timezones, no datepattern, etc) as well as some warnings signaling user
       about invalid pattern or zone (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2814):

  - filter gets mode in-operation, which gets activated if filter starts
         processing of new messages  in this mode a timestamp read from
         log-line that appeared recently (not an old line), deviating too much
         from now (up too 24h), will be considered as now (assuming a timezone
         issue), so could avoid unexpected bypass of failure (previously
         exceeding `findtime`)

  - better interaction with non-matching optional datepattern or invalid
         timestamps

  - implements special datepattern `{NONE}` - allow to find failures
         totally without date-time in log messages, whereas filter will use now
         as timestamp (gh#fail2ban/fail2ban#2802)

  * performance optimization of `datepattern` (better search algorithm in
       datedetector, especially for single template)

  * fail2ban-client: ex ...
