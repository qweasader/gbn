     Update to 1.15.0/1.15.1

  * This release fixes a vulnerability where Syncthing and the relay
         server can crash due to malformed relay protocol messages
         (CVE-2021-21404)  see GHSA-x462-89pf-6r5h. (boo#1184428)

  * This release updates the CLI to use subcommands and adds the
         subcommands cli (previously standalone stcli utility) and decrypt (for
         offline verifying and decrypting encrypted folders).

  * With this release we invite everyone to test the 'untrusted
         (encrypted) devices' feature. You should not use it yet on important
         production data. Thus UI controls are hidden behind a feature flag.
         For more information, visit:
     Update to 1.14.0

  * This release adds configurable device and folder defaults.

  * The output format of the /rest/db/browse endpoint has changed.

     update to 1.13.1:

  * Bugfixes

  * Official builds of v1.13.0 come with the Tech Ui, which is impossible
         to switch back from

     update to 1.12.1:

  * Invalid names are allowed and 'auto accepted' in folder root path on
         Windows

  * Sometimes indexes for some folders aren&#x27 t sent after starting Syncthing

  * [Untrusted] Remove Unexpected Items leaves things behind

  * Wrong theme on selection

  * Quic spamming address resolving

  * Deleted locally changed items still shown as locally changed

  * Allow specifying remote expected web UI port which would generate a
         href somewhere

  * Ignore fsync errors when saving ignore files

     Update to 1.12.0

  - The 1.12.0 release

  - adds a new config REST API.

  - The 1.11.0 release

  - adds the sendFullIndexOnUpgrade option to control whether all index
           data is resent when an upgrade is detected, equivalent to starting
           Syncthing with --reset-deltas. ...
