     redis 6.0.13

  * CVE-2021-29477: Integer overflow in STRALGO LCS command (boo#1185729)

  * CVE-2021-29478: Integer overflow in COPY command for large intsets
       (boo#1185730)

  * Cluster: Skip unnecessary check which may prevent failure detection

  * Fix performance regression in BRPOP on Redis 6.0

  * Fix edge-case when a module client is unblocked

     redis 6.0.12:

  * Fix compilation error on non-glibc systems if jemalloc is not used

     redis 6.0.11:

  * CVE-2021-21309: Avoid 32-bit overflows when proto-max-bulk-len is set
       high (boo#1182657)

  * Fix handling of threaded IO and CLIENT PAUSE (failover), could lead to
       data loss or a crash

  * Fix the selection of a random element from large hash tables

  * Fix broken protocol in client tracking tracking-redir-broken message

  * XINFO able to access expired keys on a replica

  * Fix broken protocol in redis-benchmark when used with -a or --dbnum

  * Avoid assertions (on older kernels) when testing arm64 CoW bug

  * CONFIG REWRITE should honor umask settings

  * Fix firstkey, lastkey, step in COMMAND command for some commands

  * RM_ZsetRem: Delete key if empty, the bug could leave empty zset keys

     redis 6.0.10:

     Command behavior changes:

  * SWAPDB invalidates WATCHed keys (#8239)

  * SORT command behaves differently when used on a writable replica (#8283)

  * EXISTS should not alter LRU (#8016) In Redis 5.0 and 6.0 it would have
       touched the LRU/LFU of the key.

  * OBJECT should not reveal logically expired keys (#8016) Will now behave
       the same TYPE or any other non-DEBUG command.

  * GEORADIUS[BYMEMBER] can fail with -OOM if Redis is over the memory limit
       (#8107)

     Other behavior changes:

  * Sentinel: Fix missing updates to the config file after SENTINEL SET
       command (#8229)

  * CONFIG REWRITE is atomic and safer, but requires write access to the
       config file&#x27 s folder (#7824, #8051) This change was already present in
       6.0.9, but was missing from the release notes.

     Bug fixes with compatibility implications (bugs introduced in Redis 6.0):

  * Fix RDB CRC64 checksum on big-endian systems (#8270) If you&#x27 re using
       big-endian please consider the compatibility implications with RESTORE,
       replication and persistence.

  * Fix wrong order of key/value in Lua&#x27 s map response (#8266) If your
       scripts use redis.setresp() or return a map (new in Redis 6.0), please
       consider the implications.
