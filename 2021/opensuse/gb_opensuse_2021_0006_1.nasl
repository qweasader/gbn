  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for privoxy fixes the following issues:

     privoxy was updated to 3.0.29:

  * Fixed memory leaks when a response is buffered and the buffer limit is
       reached or Privoxy is running out of memory. OVE-20201118-0001

  * Fixed a memory leak in the show-status CGI handler when no action files
       are configured OVE-20201118-0002

  * Fixed a memory leak in the show-status CGI handler when no filter files
       are configured OVE-20201118-0003

  * Fixes a memory leak when client tags are active OVE-20201118-0004

  * Fixed a memory leak if multiple filters are executed and the last one is
       skipped due to a pcre error OVE-20201118-0005

  * Prevent an unlikely dereference of a NULL-pointer that could result in a
       crash if accept-intercepted-requests was enabled, Privoxy failed to get
       the request destination from the Host header and a memory allocation
       failed. OVE-20201118-0006

  * Fixed memory leaks in the client-tags CGI handler when client tags are
       configured and memory allocations fail. OVE-20201118-0007

  * Fixed memory leaks in the show-status CGI handler when memory
       allocations fail OVE-20201118-0008

  * Add experimental https inspection support

  * Use JIT compilation for static filtering for speedup

  * Add support for Brotli decompression, add &#x27 no-brotli-accepted&#x27  filter
       which prevents the use of Brotli compression

  * Add feature to gather extended statistics

  * Use IP_FREEBIND socket option to help with failover

  * Allow to use extended host patterns and vanilla host patterns at the
       same time by prefixing extended host patterns with 'PCRE-HOST-PATTERN:'

  * Added 'Cross-origin resource sharing' (CORS) support

  * Add SOCKS5 username/password support

  * Bump the maximum number of action and filter files to 100 each

  * Fixed handling of filters with 'split-large-forms 1' when using the CGI
       editor.

  * Better detect a mismatch of connection details when figuring out whether
       or not a connection can be reused

  * Don&#x27 t send a 'Connection failure' message instead of the 'DNS
  failure'
       message

  * Let LOG_LEVEL_REQUEST log all requests

  * Improvements to default Action file

     License changed to GPLv3.
