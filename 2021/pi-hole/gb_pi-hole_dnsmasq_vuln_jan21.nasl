  - CVE-2020-25681: A heap-based buffer overflow in sort_rrset() when DNSSEC is used.

  - CVE-2020-25682: A buffer overflow in extract_name() function due to missing length check, when
  DNSSEC is enabled.

  - CVE-2020-25683: A heap-based buffer overflow when DNSSEC is enabled. This flaw is caused by the
  lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute
  memcpy() with a negative size in get_rdata().

  - CVE-2020-25684: A lack of proper address/port check implemented in the reply_query function.

  - CVE-2020-25685: A lack of query resource name (RRNAME) checks implemented in the reply_query
  function.

  - CVE-2020-25686: Multiple DNS query requests for the same resource name (RRNAME) allows for
  remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic, using a birthday attack (RFC 5452).

  - CVE-2020-25687: A heap-based buffer overflow with large memcpy in sort_rrset() when DNSSEC is
  enabled. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could

  arbitrary data into target device's memory that can lead to memory corruption and other unexpected
  behaviors on the target device.

  - CVE-2020-25683: A remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause
  an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw could be abused to make the code execute memcpy()
  with a negative size in get_rdata() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a Denial of Service.

  - CVE-2020-25684: This flaw makes it easier to forge replies to an off-path attacker.

  - CVE-2020-25685: This flaw allows remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic that can lead to DNS cache
  poisoning.
