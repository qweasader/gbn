CVE-2017-15108

spice-vdagent does not properly escape save directory before passing to shell, allowing local attacker with access to the session the agent runs in to inject arbitrary commands to be executed.

CVE-2020-25650

A flaw was found in the way the spice-vdagentd daemon handled file transfers from the host system to the virtual machine. Any unprivileged local guest user with access to the UNIX domain socket path `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock` could use this flaw to perform a memory denial of service for spice-vdagentd or even other processes in the VM system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. This flaw affects spice-vdagent versions 0.20 and previous versions.

CVE-2020-25651

A flaw was found in the SPICE file transfer protocol. File data from the host system can end up in full or in parts in the client connection of an illegitimate local user in the VM system. Active file transfers from other users could also be interrupted, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality as well as system availability.

CVE-2020-25652

A flaw was found in the spice-vdagentd daemon, where it did not properly handle client connections that can be established via the UNIX domain socket in `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock`. Any unprivileged local guest user could use this flaw to prevent legitimate agents from connecting to the spice-vdagentd daemon, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

CVE-2020-25653

A race condition vulnerability was found in the way the spice-vdagentd daemon handled new client connections. This flaw may allow an unprivileged local guest user to become the active agent for spice-vdagentd, possibly resulting in a denial of service or information leakage from the host. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality as well as system availability.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 0.17.0-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your spice-vdagent packages.
