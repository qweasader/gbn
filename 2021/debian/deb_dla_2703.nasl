This script broke for stretch at the end of 2018 when the URL changed.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version 20160613.1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ieee-data packages.

For the detailed security status of ieee-data please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
