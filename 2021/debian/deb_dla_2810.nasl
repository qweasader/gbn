CVE-2021-41099: Integer to heap buffer overflow handling certain string commands and network payloads, when proto-max-bulk-len is manually configured to a non-default, very large value.

CVE-2021-32762: Integer to heap buffer overflow issue in redis-cli and redis-sentinel parsing large multi-bulk replies on some older and less common platforms.

CVE-2021-32687: Integer to heap buffer overflow with intsets, when set-max-intset-entries is manually configured to a non-default, very large value.

CVE-2021-32675: Denial Of Service when processing RESP request payloads with a large number of elements on many connections.

CVE-2021-32672: Random heap reading issue with Lua Debugger.

CVE-2021-32626: Specially crafted Lua scripts may result with Heap buffer overflow.

For Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 3:3.2.6-3+deb9u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.
