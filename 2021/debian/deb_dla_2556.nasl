CVE-2020-12662

Unbound has Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume, aka an NXNSAttack issue. This is triggered by random subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records.

CVE-2020-12663

Unbound has an infinite loop via malformed DNS answers received from upstream servers.

CVE-2020-28935

Unbound contains a local vulnerability that would allow for a local symlink attack. When writing the PID file Unbound creates the file if it is not there, or opens an existing file for writing. In case the file was already present, it would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink instead of a regular file.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 1.9.0-2+deb10u2~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your unbound1.9 packages.

For the detailed security status of unbound1.9 please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be found at: [link moved to references]");
