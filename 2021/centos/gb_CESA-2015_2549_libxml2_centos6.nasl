Several denial of service flaws were found in libxml2, a library providing
support for reading, modifying, and writing XML and HTML files. A remote
attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when
processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to
use an excessive amount of CPU, leak potentially sensitive information, or
in certain cases crash the application. (CVE-2015-5312, CVE-2015-7497,
