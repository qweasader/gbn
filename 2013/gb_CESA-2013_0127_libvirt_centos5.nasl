  Bus and device IDs were ignored when attempting to attach multiple USB
  devices with identical vendor or product IDs to a guest. This could result
  in the wrong device being attached to a guest, giving that guest root
  access to the device. (CVE-2012-2693)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the libvirtd library failed to set the autostart flags for
  already defined QEMU domains. This bug has been fixed, and the domains can
  now be successfully marked as autostarted. (BZ#675319)

  * Prior to this update, the virFileAbsPath() function was not taking into
  account the slash ('/') directory separator when allocating memory for
  combining the cwd() function and a path. This behavior could lead to a
  memory corruption. With this update, a transformation to the virAsprintff()
  function has been introduced into virFileAbsPath(). As a result, the
  aforementioned behavior no longer occurs. (BZ#680289)

  * With this update, a man page of the virsh user interface has been
  enhanced with information on the 'domxml-from-native' and
  'domxml-to-native' commands. A correct notation of the format argument has
  been clarified. As a result, confusion is avoided when setting the format
  argument in the described commands. (BZ#783001)

  All users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  the updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.");
