The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in version 2:3.14.4-1.

The packages in the stable distribution were updated to the latest patch release 3.14.4 of the library to also include a regression bugfix for a flaw that affects the libpkix certificate verification cache. More information can be found via:

[link moved to references]

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in version 2:3.15.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2:3.15.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.");
