CVE-2013-2837

Use-after-free vulnerability in the SVG implementation allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2838

Google V8, as used in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2013-2839

Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during handling of clipboard data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2840

Use-after-free vulnerability in the media loader in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-2846.

CVE-2013-2841

Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of Pepper resources.

CVE-2013-2842

Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of widgets.

CVE-2013-2843

Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of speech data.

CVE-2013-2844

Use-after-free vulnerability in the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) implementation in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to style resolution.

CVE-2013-2845

The Web Audio implementation in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2846

Use-after-free vulnerability in the media loader in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-2840.

CVE-2013-2847

Race condition in the workers implementation in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2848

The XSS Auditor in Chromium before 27.0.1453.93 might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.
