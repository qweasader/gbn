CVE-2011-4971

Stefan Bucur reported that memcached could be caused to crash by sending a specially crafted packet.

CVE-2013-7239

It was reported that SASL authentication could be bypassed due to a flaw related to the management of the SASL authentication state. With a specially crafted request, a remote attacker may be able to authenticate with invalid SASL credentials.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.5-1+deb6u1. Note that the patch for CVE-2013-7239 was not applied for the oldstable distribution as SASL support is not enabled in this version. This update also provides the fix for CVE-2013-0179 which was fixed for stable already.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.13-0.2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.");
