computers by using Remote Desktop Services.

If you enable this policy setting, users who are members of the Remote Desktop Users group on the
target computer can connect remotely to the target computer by using Remote Desktop Services.

If you disable this policy setting, users cannot connect remotely to the target computer by using
Remote Desktop Services. The target computer will maintain any current connections, but will not
accept any new incoming connections.

If you do not configure this policy setting, Remote Desktop Services uses the Remote Desktop setting
on the target computer to determine whether the remote connection is allowed. This setting is found
on the Remote tab in the System properties sheet. By default, remote connections are not allowed.

Note: You can limit which clients are able to connect remotely by using Remote Desktop Services by
configuring the policy setting at Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Security\Require user authentication
for remote connections by using Network Level Authentication.

You can limit the number of users who can connect simultaneously by configuring the policy setting
at Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote
Desktop Session Host\Connections\Limit number of connections, or by configuring the policy setting
Maximum Connections by using the Remote Desktop Session Host WMI Provider.
