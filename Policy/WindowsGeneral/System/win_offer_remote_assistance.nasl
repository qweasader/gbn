If you disable this policy setting, users on this computer cannot get help from their corporate
technical support staff using Offer (Unsolicited) Remote Assistance.

If you do not configure this policy setting, users on this computer cannot get help from their
corporate technical support staff using Offer (Unsolicited) Remote Assistance.

If you enable this policy setting, you have two ways to allow helpers to provide Remote Assistance:
'Allow helpers to only view the computer' or 'Allow helpers to remotely control the computer.'
When you configure this policy setting, you also specify the list of users or user groups that are
allowed to offer remote assistance.

If you enable this policy setting, you should also enable firewall exceptions to allow Remote
Assistance communications. The firewall exceptions required for Offer (Unsolicited) Remote
Assistance depend on the version of Windows you are running.
