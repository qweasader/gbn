contacts', and 'Enable paid services'.

'Connect to suggested open hotspots' enables Windows to automatically connect users to open hotspots
it knows about by crowdsourcing networks that other people using Windows have connected to.

'Connect to networks shared by my contacts' enables Windows to automatically connect to networks
that the user's contacts have shared with them, and enables users on this device to share networks
with their contacts.

'Enable paid services' enables Windows to temporarily connect to open hotspots to determine if paid
services are available.

If this policy setting is disabled, both 'Connect to suggested open hotspots', 'Connect to networks
shared by my contacts' and 'Enable paid services' will be turned off and users on this device will
be prevented from enabling them.

If this policy setting is not configured or is enabled, users can choose to enable or disable either
'Connect to suggested open hotspots' or 'Connect to networks shared by my contacts'.
