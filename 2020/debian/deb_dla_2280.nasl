CVE-2018-20406

Modules/_pickle.c has an integer overflow via a large LONG_BINPUT value that is mishandled during a resize to twice the size attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or hundreds of gigabytes of data.

CVE-2018-20852

http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in Lib/http/cookiejar.py does not correctly validate the domain: it can be tricked into sending existing cookies to the wrong server. An attacker may abuse this flaw by using a server with a hostname that has another valid hostname as a suffix (e.g., pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for example.com). When a program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to do an HTTP connection to an attacker-controlled server, existing cookies can be leaked to the attacker.

CVE-2019-5010

An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the X509 certificate parser. A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted certificates to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2019-9636

Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with rn (specifically in the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with rn (specifically in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression was discovered in python, which still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, ...
