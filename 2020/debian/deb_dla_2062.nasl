  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was found that sa-exim, the SpamAssassin filter for Exim, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code if users are allowed to run custom rules. A similar issue was fixed in spamassassin, CVE-2018-11805, which caused a functional regression in sa-exim. This update restores the compatibility between spamassassin and sa-exim. The security implications of sa-exim's greylisting function are also documented in /usr/share/doc/sa-exim/README.greylisting.gz.

For Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version 4.2.1-14+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sa-exim packages.
