CVE-2019-17670

WordPress has a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability because Windows paths are mishandled during certain validation of relative URLs.

CVE-2020-4047

Authenticated users with upload permissions (like authors) are able to inject JavaScript into some media file attachment pages in a certain way. This can lead to script execution in the context of a higher privileged user when the file is viewed by them.

CVE-2020-4048

Due to an issue in wp_validate_redirect() and URL sanitization, an arbitrary external link can be crafted leading to unintended/open redirect when clicked.

CVE-2020-4049

When uploading themes, the name of the theme folder can be crafted in a way that could lead to JavaScript execution in /wp-admin on the themes page.

CVE-2020-4050

Misuse of the `set-screen-option` filter's return value allows arbitrary user meta fields to be saved. It does require an admin to install a plugin that would misuse the filter. Once installed, it can be leveraged by low privileged users.

Additionally, this upload ensures latest comments can only be viewed from public posts, and fixes back the user activation procedure.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.7.18+dfsg-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
