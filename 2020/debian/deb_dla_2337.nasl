CVE-2018-20852

By using a malicious server an attacker might steal cookies that are meant for other domains.

CVE-2019-5010

NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.

CVE-2019-9636

Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with rn (specifically in the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with rn (specifically in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied.

CVE-2019-20907

Opening a crafted tar file could result in an infinite loop due to missing header validation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 2.7.13-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
