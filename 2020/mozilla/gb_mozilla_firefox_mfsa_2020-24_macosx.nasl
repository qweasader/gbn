  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"CVE-2020-12415: AppCache manifest poisoning due to url encoded character processing
When %2F was present in a manifest URL, Firefox's AppCache behavior may have become confused and allowed a manifest to be served from a subdirectory. This could cause the appcache to be used to service requests for the top level directory.

CVE-2020-12416: Use-after-free in WebRTC VideoBroadcaster
A VideoStreamEncoder may have been freed in a race condition with VideoBroadcaster::AddOrUpdateSink, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2020-12417: Memory corruption due to missing sign-extension for ValueTags on ARM64
Due to confusion about ValueTags on JavaScript Objects, an object may pass through the type barrier, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.Note: this issue only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.

CVE-2020-12418: Information disclosure due to manipulated URL object
Manipulating individual parts of a URL object could have caused an out-of-bounds read, leaking process memory to malicious JavaScript.

CVE-2020-12419: Use-after-free in nsGlobalWindowInner
When processing callbacks that occurred during window flushing in the parent process, the associated window may die, causing a use-after-free condition. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2020-12420: Use-After-Free when trying to connect to a STUN server
When trying to connect to a STUN server, a race condition could have caused a use-after-free of a pointer, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2020-12402: RSA Key Generation vulnerable to side-channel attack
During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes. We would like to thank Sohaib ul Hassan for contributing a fix for this issue as well.Note: An unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top of it might.

CVE-2020-12421: Add-On updates did not respect the same certificate trust rules as software updates
When performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.) This could have caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently without notification to the user.

CVE-2020-12422: Integer overflow in nsJPEGEncoder::emptyOutputBuffer
In non-standard configurations, a JPEG image created by JavaScript could have caused an internal variable to overflow, resulting in an out of bounds write, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.
