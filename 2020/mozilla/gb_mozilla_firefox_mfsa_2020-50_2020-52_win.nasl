  - Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code.

  - Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption.

  - Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls.

  - Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI.

  - Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android.

  - XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API).

  - OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android.

  - Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions.

  - Use-after-free in WebRequestService.

  - Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray.

  - Heap buffer overflow in freetype.

  - DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses.

  - Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill.

  - History and Location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser.

  - Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords.

  - Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network.

  - Mutation Observers could break or confuse Firefox Screenshots feature.
