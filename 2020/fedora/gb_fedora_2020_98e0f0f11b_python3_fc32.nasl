interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3-libs package,

The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
python3-tkinter and python3-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the python3-docs package.
