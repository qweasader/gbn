internal 32-bit CRCs [checksums] and decompressing the image data), it can
optionally dump almost all of the chunk-level information in the image in
human-readable form. For example, it can be used to print the basic statistics
about an image (dimensions, bit depth, etc.), to list the color and
transparency info in its palette (assuming it has one), or to extract the
embedded text annotations. This is a command-line program with batch
capabilities.

The current release supports all PNG, MNG and JNG chunks, including the newly
approved sTER stereo-layout chunk. It correctly reports errors in all but two
of the images in Chris Nokleberg&#39, s brokensuite-20061204.");
