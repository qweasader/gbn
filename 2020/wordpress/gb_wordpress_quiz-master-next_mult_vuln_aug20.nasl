  vulnerabilities.");

  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"If a quiz contained a file upload which was configured to only
  accept .txt files, an executable PHP file could be uploaded by setting the 'Content-Type' field to
  'text/plain' to bypass the plugin's weak checks. This meant that unauthenticated users could upload
  arbitrary files, including PHP files, to a site and achieve remote code execution when there was a
  quiz enabled on the site that allowed file uploads as a response.

  Additionally Quiz and Survey Master provides file deletion functionality to remove any files that
  were uploaded during the quiz. The 'qsm_remove_file_fd_question' function is registered with a
  regular AJAX action and a nopriv AJAX action. This meant that the function could be triggered by
  unauthenticated users, which is to be expected due to the quizzes not requiring authentication.

  Unfortunately, there were no checks when verifying that the file_url supplied for file deletion was
  from a quiz or survey upload, so any file could be supplied and subsequently removed. This made it
  possible for attackers to delete important files like a site's wp-config.php file.");

  script_tag(name:"impact", value:"Successful exploitation would lead to complete site takeover and
  hosting account compromise amongst many other scenarios.

  Deleting the wp-config.php file would disable a site's database connection and allow an attacker to
  re-complete the installation procedures to connect their own database to a site's file system and
  regenerate a wp-config.php file. At that point they could use this access to infect other sites on
  the site's hosting account, or continue to use the site to infect site visitors.");
