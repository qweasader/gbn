A malicious LDAP server could use this flaw to crash a libcurl client application via a specially crafted LDAP reply.(CVE-2018-1000121)

It was found that libcurl did not safely parse FTP URLs when using the CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD method. An attacker, able to provide a specially crafted FTP URL to an application using libcurl, could write a NULL byte at an arbitrary location, resulting in a crash, or an unspecified behavior.(CVE-2018-1000120)

It was found that the libcurl library did not prevent TLS session resumption when the client certificate had changed. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate.(CVE-2016-5419)

A buffer overrun flaw was found in the IMAP handler of libcurl. By tricking an unsuspecting user into connecting to a malicious IMAP server, an attacker could exploit this flaw to potentially cause information disclosure or crash the application.(CVE-2017-1000257)

A buffer over-read exists in curl 7.20.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 in the RTSP+RTP handling code that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or information leakage(CVE-2018-1000122)

The FTP wildcard function in curl and libcurl before 7.57.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a string that ends with an '' character.(CVE-2017-8817)
