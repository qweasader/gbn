Under certain conditions, the integrity of EAPOL-Key messages is not checked, leading to a decryption oracle. An attacker within range of the Access Point and client can abuse the vulnerability to recover sensitive information.(CVE-2018-14526)

A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this attack to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used pairwise key (PTK-TK) by retransmitting Fast BSS Transition (FT) Reassociation Requests.(CVE-2017-13082)

A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this attack to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used group key (GTK) during a group key handshake.(CVE-2017-13080)

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that supports IEEE 802.11w allows reinstallation of the Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) during the group key handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to spoof frames from access points to clients.(CVE-2017-13081)

A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this attack to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) Peerkey (TPK) key during a TDLS handshake.(CVE-2017-13086)

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that supports IEEE 802.11w allows reinstallation of the Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) during the four-way handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to spoof frames from access points to clients.(CVE-2017-13079)

A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this attack to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used group key (GTK) during a 4-way handshake.(CVE-2017-13078)

A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this attack to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used pairwise key (PTK-TK) during a 4-way handshake.(CVE-2017-13077)

A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered.
