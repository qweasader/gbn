  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the USB-MIDI Linux kernel driver: a double-free error could be triggered for the 'umidi' object. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.(CVE-2016-2384)

A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel. There is an information leak in file 'sound/core/timer.c' of the latest mainline Linux kernel, the stack object 'tread' has a total size of 32 bytes. It contains a 8-bytes padding, which is not initialized but sent to user via copy_to_user(), resulting a kernel leak.(CVE-2016-4569)

The dgram_recvmsg function in net/ieee802154/dgram.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.4 updates a certain length value without ensuring that an associated data structure has been initialized, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or (3) recvmsg system call.(CVE-2013-7281)

The tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock function in net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving TLS.(CVE-2018-5703)

An issue was discovered in the fd_locked_ioctl function in drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver will copy a kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. An attacker can send the FDGETPRM ioctl and use the obtained kernel pointer to discover the location of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR.(CVE-2018-7755)

The usbnet_generic_cdc_bind function in drivers/net/usb/cdc_ether.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device.(CVE-2017-16649)

Heap-based buffer overflow in the wcnss_wlan_write function in drivers/net/wireless/wcnss/wcnss_wlan.c in the wcnss_wlan device driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by writing to /dev/wcnss_wlan with an unexpected amount of data.(CVE-2016-5342)

drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dib0700_devices.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device.(CVE-2017-16646)

A flaw was found in the TIPC networking subsystem which could allow for memory corruption and possible privilege escalation. The flaw involves a system with an unusually low MTU (60) on networking devices configured as bearers for the TIPC protocol. An attacker could create a packet which will overwrite memory outside of allocated space and allow for privilege escalation.(CVE-2016-8632)
