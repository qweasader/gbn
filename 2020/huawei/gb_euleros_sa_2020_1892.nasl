This could lead to local escalation of privilege by corrupting memory shared between processes, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID: A-142938932(CVE-2020-0009)

A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in versions after 4.5-rc1 in the way mremap handled DAX Huge Pages. This flaw allows a local attacker with access to a DAX enabled storage to escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2020-10757)

go7007_snd_init in drivers/media/usb/go7007/snd-go7007.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6 does not call snd_card_free for a failure path, which causes a memory leak, aka CID-9453264ef586.(CVE-2019-20810)

In the Android kernel in F2FS driver there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with system execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2019-9445)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels SELinux LSM hook implementation before version 5.7, where it incorrectly assumed that an skb would only contain a single netlink message. The hook would incorrectly only validate the first netlink message in the skb and allow or deny the rest of the messages within the skb with the granted permission without further processing.(CVE-2020-10751)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.4.7. The prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo() function in net/packet/af_packet.c can result in a denial of service (CPU consumption and soft lockup) in a certain failure case involving TPACKET_V3, aka CID-b43d1f9f7067.(CVE-2019-20812)

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.7.1. drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c has an integer overflow if k_ascii is called several times in a row, aka CID-b86dab054059. NOTE: Members in the community argue that the integer overflow does not lead to a security issue in this case.(CVE-2020-13974)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.6. In rx_queue_add_kobject() and netdev_queue_add_kobject() in net/core/net-sysfs.c, a reference count is mishandled, aka CID-a3e23f719f5c.(CVE-2019-20811)

A flaw was found in the prctl() function, where it can be used to enable indirect branch speculation after it has been disabled. This call incorrectly reports it as being 'force disabled' when it is not and opens the system to Spectre v2 attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.(CVE-2020-10768)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the Enhanced IBPB (Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier). The IBPB mitigation will be disabled when STIBP is not available or when the Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is available. This flaw allows a local attacker to perform a ...
