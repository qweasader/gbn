  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A new software page cache side channel attack scenario was discovered in operating systems that implement the very common 'page cache' caching mechanism. A malicious user/process could use 'in memory' page-cache knowledge to infer access timings to shared memory and gain knowledge which can be used to reduce effectiveness of cryptographic strength by monitoring algorithmic behavior, infer access patterns of memory to determine code paths taken, and exfiltrate data to a blinded attacker through page-granularity access times as a side-channel.(CVE-2019-5489)

An issue was discovered in the proc_pid_stack function in fs/proc/base.c in the Linux kernel. An attacker with a local account can trick the stack unwinder code to leak stack contents to userspace. The fix allows only root to inspect the kernel stack of an arbitrary task.(CVE-2018-17972)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bound write in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata(), a denial of service, and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image.(CVE-2018-10883)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bounds write and a denial of service or unspecified other impact is possible by mounting and operating a crafted ext4 filesystem image.(CVE-2018-10878)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause a use-after-free in ext4_xattr_set_entry function and a denial of service or unspecified other impact may occur by renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image.(CVE-2018-10879)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bound access in ext4_get_group_info function, a denial of service, and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image.(CVE-2018-10881)

An issue was discovered in the XFS filesystem in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr_leaf.c in the Linux kernel. A NULL pointer dereference may occur for a corrupted xfs image after xfs_da_shrink_inode() is called with a NULL bp. This can lead to a system crash and a denial of service.(CVE-2018-13094)

An issue was discovered in the XFS filesystem in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel. There is a NULL pointer dereference leading to a system panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL inode->i_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during an allocation.(CVE-2018-13093)

In the Linux kernel before 4.17, a local attacker able to set attributes on an xfs filesystem could make this filesystem non-operational until the next mount by triggering an unchecked error condition during an xfs attribute change, because xfs_attr_shortform_addname in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c mishandles ATTR_REPLACE operations with conversion of an attr from short to long form.(CVE-2018-18690)");
