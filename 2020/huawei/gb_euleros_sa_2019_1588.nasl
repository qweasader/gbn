  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel where the coredump implementation does not use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags changes while it runs. This allows local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service (DoS), or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget_not_zero or get_task_mm calls.(CVE-2019-11599)

The Siemens R3964 line discipline driver in drivers/tty/n_r3964.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.8 has multiple race conditions.(CVE-2019-11486)

A race condition in perf_event_open() allows local attackers to leak sensitive data from setuid programs. As no relevant locks (in particular the cred_guard_mutex) are held during the ptrace_may_access() call, it is possible for the specified target task to perform an execve() syscall with setuid execution before perf_event_alloc() actually attaches to it, allowing an attacker to bypass the ptrace_may_access() check and the perf_event_exit_task(current) call that is performed in install_exec_creds() during privileged execve() calls.(CVE-2019-3901)

The atyfb_ioctl function in drivers/video/fbdev/aty/atyfb_base.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.10 does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory by reading locations associated with padding bytes.(CVE-2017-14156)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem code. A use-after-free is possible in ext4_ext_remove_space() function when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image.(CVE-2018-10876)

A flaw was found in the implementation of the 'fill buffer', a mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU cache. If an attacker can generate a load operation that would create a page fault, the execution will continue speculatively with incorrect data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level caches. This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill buffer. (CVE-2018-12130)

Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the processor to hand-off address generation logic into these sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations write to a shared distributed processor structure called the 'processor store buffer'. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)

Microprocessors use a '~load port' subcomponent to perform load operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU's pipelines. Stale load operations ...
