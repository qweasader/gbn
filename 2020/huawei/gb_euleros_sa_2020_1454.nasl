Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u101, 7u85, and 8u60, and Java SE Embedded 8u51, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to 2D.(CVE-2015-4844)

International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ before 2017-02-13 has an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow related to the utf8TextAccess function in common/utext.cpp and the utext_moveIndex32* function.(CVE-2017-7868)

The Regular Expressions package in International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ before 2014-12-03, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, calculates certain values without ensuring that they can be represented in a 24-bit field, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, a related issue to CVE-2014-7923.(CVE-2014-9654)

Stack-based buffer overflow in the Locale class in common/locid.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) through 57.1 for C/C++ allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long locale string.(CVE-2016-7415)

The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) through 57.1 for C/C++ does not ensure that there is a '\0' character at the end of a certain temporary array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument.(CVE-2016-6293)

The collator implementation in i18n/ucol.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 52 through SVN revision 293126, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, does not initialize memory for a data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted character sequence.(CVE-2014-7940)

The Regular Expressions package in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 52 before SVN revision 292944, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to a zero-length quantifier.(CVE-2014-7926)
