When two OpenSSL::X509::Name objects are compared using ==, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.(CVE-2018-16395)

An issue was discovered in Ruby before 2.3.8, 2.4.x before 2.4.5, 2.5.x before 2.5.2, and 2.6.x before 2.6.0-preview3. It does not taint strings that result from unpacking tainted strings with some formats.(CVE-2018-16396)

An exploitable heap overflow vulnerability exists in the Fiddle::Function.new ''initialize'' function functionality of Ruby. In Fiddle::Function.new ''initialize'' heap buffer ''arg_types'' allocation is made based on args array length. Specially constructed object passed as element of args array can increase this array size after mentioned allocation and cause heap overflow.(CVE-2016-2339)

Type confusion exists in _cancel_eval Ruby's TclTkIp class method. Attacker passing different type of object than String as ''retval'' argument can cause arbitrary code execution.(CVE-2016-2337)");
