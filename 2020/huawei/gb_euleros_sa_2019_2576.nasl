An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in Exiv2::DataValue::read in value.cpp in Exiv2 0.26. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.(CVE-2017-14862)

An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in Exiv2::getULong in types.cpp in Exiv2 0.26. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.(CVE-2017-14864)

An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in Exiv2::StringValueBase::read in value.cpp in Exiv2 0.26. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.(CVE-2017-14859)

An issue was discovered in Exiv2 0.26. readMetadata in jp2image.cpp allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (SIGABRT) by triggering an incorrect Safe::add call.(CVE-2018-10998)

An issue was discovered in Exiv2 0.26. The Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::parseTXTChunk function has a heap-based buffer over-read.(CVE-2018-10999)

An issue was discovered in Exiv2 0.26. When the data structure of the structure ifd is incorrect, the program assigns pValue_ to 0x0, and the value of pValue() is 0x0. TiffImageEntry::doWriteImage will use the value of pValue() to cause a segmentation fault. To exploit this vulnerability, someone must open a crafted tiff file.(CVE-2017-9239)

CiffDirectory::readDirectory() at crwimage_int.cpp in Exiv2 0.26 has excessive stack consumption due to a recursive function, leading to Denial of service.(CVE-2018-17581)

Exiv2 0.26 has a Null Pointer Dereference in the Exiv2::DataValue::toLong function in value.cpp, related to crafted metadata in a TIFF file.(CVE-2017-18005)

Exiv2 through 0.27.1 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (crash due to assertion failure) via an invalid data location in a CRW image file.(CVE-2019-13113)

In Exiv2 0.26 and previous versions, PngChunk::readRawProfile in pngchunk_int.cpp may cause a denial of service (application crash due to a heap-based buffer over-read) via a crafted PNG file.(CVE-2018-19535)

In Exiv2 0.26, Exiv2::IptcParser::decode in iptc.cpp (called from psdimage.cpp in the PSD image reader) may suffer from a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read) caused by an integer overflow via a crafted PSD image file.(CVE-2018-19107)

In Exiv2 0.26, Exiv2::PsdImage::readMetadata in psdimage.cpp in the PSD image reader may suffer from a denial of service (infinite loop) caused by an integer overflow via a crafted PSD image file.(CVE-2018-19108)

In types.cpp in Exiv2 0.26, a large size value may lead to a SIGABRT during an attempt at memory allocation for an Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::zlibUncompress ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
