An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way the Apple Magic Mouse/Trackpad multi-touch driver handled Human Interface Device (HID) reports with an invalid size. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2014-3181)

An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way the Logitech Unifying receiver driver handled HID reports with an invalid device_index value. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2014-3182)

Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the Cherry Cymotion keyboard driver, KYE/Genius device drivers, Logitech device drivers, Monterey Genius KB29E keyboard driver, Petalynx Maxter remote control driver, and Sunplus wireless desktop driver handled HID reports with an invalid report descriptor size. An attacker with physical access to the system could use either of these flaws to write data past an allocated memory buffer.(CVE-2014-3184)

A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the USB ConnectTech WhiteHEAT serial driver processed completion commands sent via USB Request Blocks buffers. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2014-3185)

It was found that Linux kernel's ptrace subsystem did not properly sanitize the address-space-control bits when the program-status word (PSW) was being set. On IBM S/390 systems, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to set address-space-control bits to the kernel space, and thus gain read and write access to kernel memory.(CVE-2014-3534)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's kvm_iommu_map_pages() function handled IOMMU mapping failures. A privileged user in a guest with an assigned host device could use this flaw to crash the host.(CVE-2014-3601)

It was found that KVM's Write to Model Specific Register (WRMSR) instruction emulation would write non-canonical values passed in by the guest to certain MSRs in the host's context. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.(CVE-2014-3610)

A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem handled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user who has access to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.(CVE-2014-3611)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's keys subsystem handled the termination condition in the associative array garbage collection functionality. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
