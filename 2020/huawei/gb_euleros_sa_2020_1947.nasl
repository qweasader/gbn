An out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the USB emulator of the QEMU. This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice 'setup_len' exceeds its 'data_buf[4096]' in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.(CVE-2020-14364)

A use after free vulnerability in ip_reass() in ip_input.c of libslirp 4.2.0 and prior releases allows crafted packets to cause a denial of service.(CVE-2020-1983)

hw/net/xgmac.c in the XGMAC Ethernet controller in QEMU before 07-20-2020 has a buffer overflow. This occurs during packet transmission and affects the highbank and midway emulated machines. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential privileged code execution. This was fixed in commit 5519724a13664b43e225ca05351c60b4468e4555.(CVE-2020-15863)

The (1) v9fs_create and (2) v9fs_lcreate functions in hw/9pfs/9p.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allow local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (file descriptor or memory consumption) via vectors related to an already in-use fid.(CVE-2017-7377)

QEMU 4.1.0 has a memory leak in zrle_compress_data in ui/vnc-enc-zrle.c during a VNC disconnect operation because libz is misused, resulting in a situation where memory allocated in deflateInit2 is not freed in deflateEnd.(CVE-2019-20382)

sd_wp_addr in hw/sd/sd.c in QEMU 4.2.0 uses an unvalidated address, which leads to an out-of-bounds read during sdhci_write() operations. A guest OS user can crash the QEMU process.(CVE-2020-13253)

In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, es1370_transfer_audio in hw/audio/es1370.c does not properly validate the frame count, which allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access during an es1370_write() operation.(CVE-2020-13361)

In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, megasas_lookup_frame in hw/scsi/megasas.c has an out-of-bounds read via a crafted reply_queue_head field from a guest OS user.(CVE-2020-13362)

address_space_map in exec.c in QEMU 4.2.0 can trigger a NULL pointer dereference related to BounceBuffer.(CVE-2020-13659)

hw/pci/pci.c in QEMU 4.2.0 allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access by providing an address near the end of the PCI configuration space.(CVE-2020-13791)

rom_copy() in hw/core/loader.c in QEMU 4.1.0 does not validate the relationship between two addresses, which allows attackers to trigger an invalid memory copy operation.(CVE-2020-13765)");
