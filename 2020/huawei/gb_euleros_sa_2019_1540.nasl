  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the NTLM authentication code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow. (This bug is almost identical to CVE-2017-8816.)(CVE-2018-14618)

It was found that libcurl did not safely parse FTP URLs when using the CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD method. An attacker, able to provide a specially crafted FTP URL to an application using libcurl, could write a NULL byte at an arbitrary location, resulting in a crash, or an unspecified behavior.(CVE-2018-1000120)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way libcurl checks values returned by the openldap ldap_get_attribute_ber() function. A malicious LDAP server could use this flaw to crash a libcurl client application via a specially crafted LDAP reply.(CVE-2018-1000121)

A buffer over-read exists in curl 7.20.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 in the RTSP+RTP handling code that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or information leakage.(CVE-2018-1000122)

curl version curl 7.20.0 to and including curl 7.59.0 contains a CWE-126: Buffer Over-read vulnerability in denial of service that can result in curl can be tricked into reading data beyond the end of a heap based buffer used to store downloaded RTSP content.. (CVE-2018-1000301)

A buffer overrun flaw was found in the IMAP handler of libcurl. By tricking an unsuspecting user into connecting to a malicious IMAP server, an attacker could exploit this flaw to potentially cause information disclosure or crash the application.(CVE-2017-1000257)

It was found that curl and libcurl might send their Authentication header to a third party HTTP server upon receiving an HTTP REDIRECT reply. This could leak authentication token to external entities. (CVE-2018-1000007)");
