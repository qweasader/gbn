  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server's parsing of configuration directives. A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a crafted message.(CVE-2017-6463)

ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8, when autokey is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (peer-variable clearing and association outage) by sending (1) a spoofed crypto-NAK packet or (2) a packet with an incorrect MAC value at a certain time.(CVE-2016-4955)

The ntpq and ntpdc command-line utilities that are part of ntp package are vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow via crafted hostname. Applications using these vulnerable utilities with an untrusted input may be potentially exploited, resulting in a crash or arbitrary code execution under privileges of that application.(CVE-2018-12327)

NTP before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92, when mode7 is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (ntpd abort) by using the same IP address multiple times in an unconfig directive.(CVE-2016-2516)

A flaw was found in the way NTP verified trusted keys during symmetric key authentication. An authenticated client (A) could use this flaw to modify a packet sent between a server (B) and a client (C) using a key that is different from the one known to the client (A).(CVE-2015-7974)

A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd was configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory.(CVE-2015-7701)

An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain packets. An authenticated attacker could use a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode of 7 and larger, which could potentially (although highly unlikely) cause ntpd to crash.(CVE-2016-2518)

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the NTP autokey protocol was implemented. When an NTP client decrypted a secret received from an NTP server, it could cause that client to crash.(CVE-2014-9750)

It was found that NTP's :config command could be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals).(CVE-2015-7703)

A flaw was found in the way ntpd running on a host with multiple network interfaces handled certain server responses. A remote attacker could use this flaw which would cause ntpd to not synchronize with the source.(CVE-2016-7429)

A flaw was found in the way ntpd implemented the trap service. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2016-9311)

It was found that ntp-keygen used a weak method for ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
