  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An issue was discovered in Squid 3.3.9 through 3.5.28 and 4.x through 4.7. When Squid is configured to use Digest authentication, it parses the header Proxy-Authorization. It searches for certain tokens such as domain, uri, and qop. Squid checks if this token's value starts with a quote and ends with one. If so, it performs a memcpy of its length minus 2. Squid never checks whether the value is just a single quote (which would satisfy its requirements), leading to a memcpy of its length minus 1.(CVE-2019-12525)

The cachemgr.cgi web module of Squid through 4.7 has XSS via the user_name or auth parameter.(CVE-2019-13345)

An issue was discovered in Squid 4.0.23 through 4.7. When checking Basic Authentication with HttpHeader::getAuth, Squid uses a global buffer to store the decoded data. Squid does not check that the decoded length isn't greater than the buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow with user controlled data.(CVE-2019-12527)

An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x through 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x through 3.5.28, and 4.x through 4.7. When Squid is configured to use Basic Authentication, the Proxy-Authorization header is parsed via uudecode. uudecode determines how many bytes will be decoded by iterating over the input and checking its table. The length is then used to start decoding the string. There are no checks to ensure that the length it calculates isn't greater than the input buffer. This leads to adjacent memory being decoded as well. An attacker would not be able to retrieve the decoded data unless the Squid maintainer had configured the display of usernames on error pages.(CVE-2019-12529)

Due to incorrect string termination, Squid cachemgr.cgi 4.0 through 4.7 may access unallocated memory. On systems with memory access protections, this can cause the CGI process to terminate unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service for all clients using it.(CVE-2019-12854)");
