Integer overflow in the VNC display driver in QEMU before 2.1.0 allows attachers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via a CLIENT_CUT_TEXT message, which triggers an infinite loop.(CVE-2015-5239)

The ne2000_receive function in hw
et
e2000.c in QEMU before 2.4.0.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and instance crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to receiving packets.(CVE-2015-5278)

Buffer overflow in the send_control_msg function in hw/char/virtio-serial-bus.c in QEMU before 2.4.0 allows guest users to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash) via a crafted virtio control message.(CVE-2015-5745)

tcp_emu in tcp_subr.c in libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, mismanages memory, as demonstrated by IRC DCC commands in EMU_IRC. This can cause a heap-based buffer overflow or other out-of-bounds access which can lead to a DoS or potential execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2020-7039)

Qemu before version 2.9 is vulnerable to an improper link following when built with the VirtFS. A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access host file system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their privileges on a host.(CVE-2016-9602)

The ohci_service_ed_list function in hw/usb/hcd-ohci.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) before 2.9.0 allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via vectors involving the number of link endpoint list descriptors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-9330.(CVE-2017-6505)

qmp_guest_file_read in qga/commands-posix.c and qga/commands-win32.c in qemu-ga (aka QEMU Guest Agent) in QEMU 2.12.50 has an integer overflow causing a g_malloc0() call to trigger a segmentation fault when trying to allocate a large memory chunk. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted QMP command (including guest-file-read with a large count value) to the agent via the listening socket.(CVE-2018-12617)

Memory leak in hw/audio/ac97.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (host memory consumption and QEMU process crash) via a large number of device unplug operations.(CVE-2017-5525)

Memory leak in hw/audio/es1370.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (host memory consumption and QEMU process crash) via a large number of device unplug operations.(CVE-2017-5526)

QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) before 2.9.0, when built with the USB OHCI Emulation support, allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by leveraging an incorrect return value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-6505.(CVE-2017-9330)
