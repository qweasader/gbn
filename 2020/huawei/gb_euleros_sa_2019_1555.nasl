  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was found that when ntp is configured with rate limiting for all associations the limits are also applied to responses received from its configured sources. A remote attacker who knows the sources can cause a denial of service by preventing ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources.(CVE-2016-7426)

ntpq in NTP before 4.2.8p7 allows remote attackers to obtain origin timestamps and then impersonate peers via unspecified vectors.(CVE-2015-8139)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash ntpd.(CVE-2015-7977)

A vulnerability was found in NTP, in the parsing of packets from the /dev/datum device. A malicious device could send crafted messages, causing ntpd to crash.(CVE-2017-6462)

The process_packet function in ntp_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (peer-variable modification) by sending spoofed packets from many source IP addresses in a certain scenario, as demonstrated by triggering an incorrect leap indication.(CVE-2016-4954)

It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands.(CVE-2015-5194)

It was discovered that the sntp utility could become unresponsive due to being caught in an infinite loop when processing a crafted NTP packet.(CVE-2015-5219)

It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check the originate timestamp in received packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a crafted packet to an ntpd client that would effectively disable synchronization with the server, or push arbitrary offset/delay measurements to modify the time on the client.(CVE-2015-8138)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp_crypto.c, where a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd.(CVE-2015-7702)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in ntpd's crypto_recv(), ctl_putdata(), and configure() functions. A remote attacker could use either of these flaws to send a specially crafted request packet that could crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ntp user. Note: the crypto_recv() flaw requires non default configurations to be active, while the ctl_putdata() flaw, by default, can only be exploited via local attackers, and the configure() flaw requires additional authentication to exploit.(CVE-2014-9295)

It was found that an ntpd client could be forced to change from basic client/server mode to the interleaved symmetric mode. A remote attacker could use a spoofed packet that, ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
