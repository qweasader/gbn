  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The x25_negotiate_facilities function in net/x25/x25_facilities.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5.5 does not properly initialize a certain data structure, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an X.25 Call Request.(CVE-2016-4580)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of seq_file where a local attacker could manipulate memory in the put() function pointer. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privileged escalation.(CVE-2016-7910)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem handled generic protocol tracking. As demonstrated in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) case, a remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended iptables rule restrictions when the associated connection tracking module was not loaded on the system.(CVE-2014-8160)

The get_endpoints function in drivers/usb/misc/usbtest.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device.(CVE-2017-16532)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled user controls. A local, privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2014-4656)

The sr_do_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 4.16.12 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact because sense buffers have different sizes at the CDROM layer and the SCSI layer.(CVE-2018-11506)

A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation handled Address Configuration lists when performing Address Configuration Change (ASCONF). A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the system via a race condition triggered by setting certain ASCONF options on a socket.(CVE-2015-3212)

A symlink size validation was missing in Linux kernels built with UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS) support, allowing the corruption of kernel memory. An attacker able to mount a corrupted/malicious UDF file system image could cause the kernel to crash.(CVE-2014-9729)

The Linux kernel before version 4.11 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in fs/cifs/cifsencrypt.c:setup_ntlmv2_rsp() that allows an attacker controlling a CIFS server to kernel panic a client that has this server mounted, because an empty TargetInfo field in an NTLMSSP setup negotiation response is mishandled during session recovery.(CVE-2018-1066)

drivers/hid/hid-sensor-hub.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_SENSOR_HUB is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted device.(CVE-2013-2898)
