A remote attacker who knows the sources can cause a denial of service by preventing ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources. (CVE-2016-7426)

A flaw was found in the control mode functionality of ntpd. A remote attacker could send a crafted control mode packet which could lead to information disclosure or result in DDoS amplification attacks. (CVE-2016-9310)

A flaw was found in the way ntpd implemented the trap service. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-9311)

A flaw was found in the way ntpd running on a host with multiple network interfaces handled certain server responses. A remote attacker could use this flaw which would cause ntpd to not synchronize with the source. (CVE-2016-7429)

A flaw was found in the way ntpd calculated the root delay. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted spoofed packet to cause denial of service or in some special cases even crash. (CVE-2016-7433)");
