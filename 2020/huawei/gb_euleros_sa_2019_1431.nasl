A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way various binutils utilities processed certain files. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, it could cause the utility used to process that file to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that utility.(CVE-2014-8501)

The coff_slurp_line_table function in coffcode.h in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file.(CVE-2017-16826)

It was found that the fix for the CVE-2014-8485 issue was incomplete: a heap-based buffer overflow in the objdump utility could cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running objdump when processing specially crafted files.(CVE-2014-8502)

A directory traversal flaw was found in the strip and objcopy utilities. A specially crafted file could cause strip or objdump to overwrite an arbitrary file writable by the user running either of these utilities.(CVE-2014-8737)

The bfd_section_from_shdr function in elf.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a large attribute section.(CVE-2018-8945)

In the coff_pointerize_aux function in coffgen.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, an index is not validated, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated by objcopy of a COFF object.(CVE-2018-7208)

dwarf1.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, mishandles pointers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file, related to parse_die and parse_line_table, as demonstrated by a parse_die heap-based buffer over-read.(CVE-2017-15020)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way various binutils utilities processed certain files. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, it could cause the utility used to process that file to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that utility.(CVE-2014-8485)
