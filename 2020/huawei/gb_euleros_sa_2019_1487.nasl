  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read and write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were already processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation, potentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array overrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2015-1805)

net/llc/sysctl_net_llc.c in the Linux kernel before 3.19 uses an incorrect data type in a sysctl table, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly have unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl entry.(CVE-2015-2041)

net/rds/sysctl.c in the Linux kernel before 3.19 uses an incorrect data type in a sysctl table, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly have unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl entry.(CVE-2015-2042)

Xen 3.3.x through 4.5.x and the Linux kernel through 3.19.1 do not properly restrict access to PCI command registers, which might allow local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (non-maskable interrupt and host crash) by disabling the (1) memory or (2) I/O decoding for a PCI Express device and then accessing the device, which triggers an Unsupported Request (UR) response.(CVE-2015-2150)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's early load microcode functionality. On a system with UEFI Secure Boot enabled, a local, privileged user could use this flaw to increase their privileges to the kernel (ring0) level, bypassing intended restrictions in place.(CVE-2015-2666)

The xsave/xrstor implementation in arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h in the Linux kernel before 3.19.2 creates certain .altinstr_replacement pointers and consequently does not provide any protection against instruction faulting, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by triggering a fault, as demonstrated by an unaligned memory operand or a non-canonical address memory operand.(CVE-2015-2672)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation implementation handled forking or closing of a task with an 'int80' entry. A local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2015-2830)

It was found that the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation for IPv6 allowed the Hop Limit value to be set to a smaller value than the default one. An attacker on a local network could use this flaw to prevent systems on that network from sending or receiving network packets.(CVE-2015-2922)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's file system implementation handled rename operations in which the source was inside and the destination was outside of a bind mount. A privileged user inside a container could use this flaw to escape the bind ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
