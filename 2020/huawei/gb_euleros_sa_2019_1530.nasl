An issue was discovered in the btrfs filesystem code in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free is possible in try_merge_free_space() when mounting a crafted btrfs image due to a lack of chunk type flag checks in btrfs_check_chunk_valid() in the fs/btrfs/volumes.c function. This could lead to a denial of service or other unspecified impact.(CVE-2018-14611)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel visor driver handles certain invalid USB device descriptors. The driver assumes that the device always has at least one bulk OUT endpoint. By using a specially crafted USB device (without a bulk OUT endpoint), an unprivileged user with physical access could trigger a kernel NULL-pointer dereference and cause a system panic (denial of service).(CVE-2015-7566)

It was found that the RFC 5961 challenge ACK rate limiting as implemented in the Linux kernel's networking subsystem allowed an off-path attacker to leak certain information about a given connection by creating congestion on the global challenge ACK rate limit counter and then measuring the changes by probing packets. An off-path attacker could use this flaw to either terminate TCP connection and/or inject payload into non-secured TCP connection between two endpoints on the network.(CVE-2016-5696)

It was found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of second socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to memory corruption. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we feel it is unlikely.(CVE-2017-15868)

A vulnerability was found in the key management subsystem of the Linux kernel. An update on an uninstantiated key could cause a kernel panic, leading to denial of service (DoS).(CVE-2017-15299)

The rfcomm_sock_bind function in net/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2 allows local users to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via vectors involving a bind system call on a Bluetooth RFCOMM socket.(CVE-2015-8956)

arch/mips/include/asm/thread_info.h in the Linux kernel before 3.14.8 on the MIPS platform does not configure _TIF_SECCOMP checks on the fast system-call path, which allows local users to bypass intended PR_SET_SECCOMP restrictions by executing a crafted application without invoking a trace or audit subsystem.(CVE-2014-4157)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem code. A stack-out-of-bounds write in ext4_update_inline_data() is possible when mounting and ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
