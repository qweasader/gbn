  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Linux kernel built with the KVM visualization support (CONFIG_KVM), with nested visualization(nVMX) feature enabled(nested=1), is vulnerable to host memory leakage issue. It could occur while emulating VMXON instruction in 'handle_vmon'. An L1 guest user could use this flaw to leak host memory potentially resulting in DoS.(CVE-2017-2596)

The (1) BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR and (2) BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension implementations in the sk_run_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 do not check whether a certain length value is sufficiently large, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer underflow and system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the __skb_get_nlattr and __skb_get_nlattr_nest functions before the vulnerability was announced.(CVE-2014-3144)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel when freeing pages in hugetlbfs. This could trigger a local denial of service by crashing the kernel.(CVE-2017-15127)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.8. Incorrect access checking in overlayfs mounts could be used by local attackers to modify or truncate files in the underlying filesystem.(CVE-2018-16597)

Memory leak in the cuse_channel_release function in fs/fuse/cuse.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by opening /dev/cuse many times.(CVE-2015-1339)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's nested NMI handler and espfix64 functionalities interacted during NMI processing. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2015-3290)

Multiple array index errors in drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_MULTITOUCH is enabled, allow physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption, or NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted device.(CVE-2013-2897)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled the requeuing of certain Priority Inheritance (PI) futexes. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2014-3153)

The XFS subsystem in the Linux kernel 4.4 and later allows local users to cause a denial of service (fdatasync() failure and system hang) by using the vfs syscall group in the 'trinity' program, as a result of a page lock order bug in the XFS seek hole/data implementation.(CVE-2016-8660)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's key management system where it was possible for an attacker to escalate privileges or crash the machine. If a user key gets negatively instantiated, an error code is cached in the payload area. A negatively instantiated key may be then be positively instantiated by ...
