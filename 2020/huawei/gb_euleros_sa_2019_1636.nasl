  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An issue was discovered in rds_tcp_kill_sock in net/rds/tcp.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.8. There is a race condition leading to a use-after-free, related to net namespace cleanup.(CVE-2019-11815)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handle_rx() function in the vhost_net driver. A malicious virtual guest, under specific conditions, can trigger an out-of-bounds write in a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host which may lead to a kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.(CVE-2018-16880)

A NULL pointer dereference security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in kvm_pv_send_ipi() in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c. This allows local users with certain privileges to cause a denial of service via a crafted system call to the KVM subsystem.(CVE-2018-19406)

The function hso_get_config_data in drivers
et/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.8 reads if_num from the USB device (as a u8) and uses it to index a small array, resulting in an object out-of-bounds (OOB) read that potentially allows arbitrary read in the kernel address space.(CVE-2018-19985)

** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.(CVE-2019-3460)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function hid_debug_events_read() in the drivers/hid/hid-debug.c file which may enter an infinite loop with certain parameters passed from a userspace. A local privileged user ('root') can cause a system lock up and a denial of service.(CVE-2019-3819)

In the Linux kernel before 4.20.14, expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c lacks a check for the mmap minimum address, which makes it easier for attackers to exploit kernel NULL pointer dereferences on non-SMAP platforms. This is related to a capability check for the wrong task.(CVE-2019-9213)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable.(CVE-2019-3882)

An infinite loop issue was found in the vhost_net kernel module in Linux Kernel up to and including v5.1-rc6, while handling incoming packets in handle_rx(). It could occur if one end sends packets faster than the other end can process them. A guest user, maybe remote one, could use this flaw to stall the vhost_net ...
