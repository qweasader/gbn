If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.(CVE-2019-9076)

An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is an attempted excessive memory allocation in elf_read_notes in elf.c.(CVE-2019-9074)

An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is an out-of-bounds read leading to a SEGV in bfd_getl32 in libbfd.c, when called from pex64_get_runtime_function in pei-x86_64.c.(CVE-2019-14250)

An issue was discovered in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is a stack consumption issue in d_count_templates_scopes in cp-demangle.c after many recursive calls.(CVE-2019-9071)

An issue was discovered in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is a heap-based buffer over-read in d_expression_1 in cp-demangle.c after many recursive calls.(CVE-2019-9070)

The demangle_template function in cplus-dem.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31.1, has a memory leak via a crafted string, leading to a denial of service (memory consumption), as demonstrated by cxxfilt, a related issue to CVE-2018-12698.(CVE-2018-20657)

The get_count function in cplus-dem.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (malloc called with the result of an integer-overflowing calculation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, as demonstrated by c++filt.(CVE-2018-18483)

The _bfd_generic_read_minisymbols function in syms.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31, has a memory leak via a crafted ELF file, leading to a denial of service (memory consumption), as demonstrated by nm.(CVE-2018-20002)

apply_relocations in readelf.c in GNU Binutils 2.32 contains an integer overflow that allows attackers to trigger a write access violation (in byte_put_little_endian function in elfcomm.c) via an ELF file, as demonstrated by readelf.(CVE-2019-14444)");
