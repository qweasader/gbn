  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the USB ConnectTech WhiteHEAT serial driver processed completion commands sent via USB Request Blocks buffers. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2014-3185)

Use-after-free vulnerability in the msm_set_crop function in drivers/media/video/msm/msm_camera.c in the MSM-Camera driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, allows attackers to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via an application that makes a crafted ioctl call.(CVE-2015-0568)

The vivid_fb_ioctl function in drivers/media/platform/vivid/vivid-osd.c in the Linux kernel through 4.3.3 does not initialize a certain structure member, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted application.(CVE-2015-7884)

The usb_get_bos_descriptor function in drivers/usb/core/config.c in the Linux kernel can allow a local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device.(CVE-2017-16535)

The ACPI parsing functionality in the Linux kernel does not flush the node and node_ext caches which causes a kernel stack dump. This allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and use this information to bypass the KASLR protection mechanism by creating and applying crafted ACPI table.(CVE-2017-13694)

The is_ashmem_file function in drivers/staging/android/ashmem.c in a certain Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android patch for the Linux kernel 3.x mishandles pointer validation within the KGSL Linux Graphics Module, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the /ashmem string as the dentry name.(CVE-2016-5340)

It was found that the Linux kernel did not properly account file descriptors passed over the unix socket against the process limit. A local user could use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system.(CVE-2013-4312)

Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to v4.13-rc1. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted NL80211_CMD_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is unlikely.(CVE-2017-7541)

A flaw in the netback module allowed frontends to control mapping of requests to request queues. An attacker can change this mapping by requesting invalid mapping requests allowing the (usually ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
