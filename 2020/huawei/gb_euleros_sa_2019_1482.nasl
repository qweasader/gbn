  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An information-leak vulnerability was found in the kernel when it truncated a file to a smaller size which consisted of an inline extent that was compressed. The data between the new file size and the old file size was not discarded and the number of bytes used by the inode were not correctly decremented, which gave the wrong report for callers of the stat(2) syscall. This wasted metadata space and allowed for the truncated data to be leaked, and data corruption or loss to occur. A caller of the clone ioctl could exploit this flaw by using only standard file-system operations without root access to read the truncated data.(CVE-2015-8374)

crypto/pcrypt.c in the Linux kernel, before 4.14.13, mishandles freeing instances, allowing a local user able to access the AF_ALG-based AEAD interface (CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_AEAD) and pcrypt (CONFIG_CRYPTO_PCRYPT) to cause a denial of service (kfree of an incorrect pointer) or possibly have unspecified other impact by executing a crafted sequence of system calls. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.(CVE-2017-18075)

An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Qualcomm Wi-Fi driver could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as High because it first requires compromising a privileged process. Product: Android. Versions: N/A. Android ID: A-32835279. References: QC-CR#1096945.(CVE-2017-0523)

The saa7164_bus_get function in drivers/media/pci/saa7164/saa7164-bus.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.14 allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact by changing a certain sequence-number value, aka a 'double fetch' vulnerability.(CVE-2017-8831)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's splice() system call validated its parameters. On certain file systems, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to write past the maximum file size, and thus crash the system.(CVE-2014-7822)

The vc4_get_bcl function in drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/vc4_gem.c in the VideoCore DRM driver in the Linux kernel before 4.9.7 does not set an errno value upon certain overflow detections allowing local users to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer dereference and OOPS) via inconsistent size values in a VC4_SUBMIT_CL ioctl call.(CVE-2017-5577)

In fs/ocfs2/cluster/nodemanager.c in the Linux kernel before 4.15, local users can cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and BUG) because a required mutex is not used.(CVE-2017-18216)

A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET_V3 ring buffer. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
