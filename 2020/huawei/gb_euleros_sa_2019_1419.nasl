  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The log_cookie function in mod_log_config.c in the mod_log_config module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and daemon crash) via a crafted cookie that is not properly handled during truncation.(CVE-2014-0098)

A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in the mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page served by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module (MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd child process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the 'apache' user.(CVE-2014-0226)

It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning.(CVE-2016-8743)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod_cache httpd module handled Content-Type headers. A malicious HTTP server could cause the httpd child process to crash when the Apache HTTP server was configured to proxy to a server with caching enabled.(CVE-2014-3581)

Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks.(CVE-2015-3183)

In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.(CVE-2017-15710)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd's mod_ssl module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an httpd child process to crash if another module used by httpd called a certain API function during the processing of an HTTPS request.(CVE-2017-3169)
