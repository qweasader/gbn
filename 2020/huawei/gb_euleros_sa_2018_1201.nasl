Use-after-free vulnerability in the sofree function in slirp/socket.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows attackers to cause a denial of service (QEMU instance crash) by leveraging failure to properly clear ifq_so from pending packets.(CVE-2017-13711)

VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator (QEMU) 2.11.0 and older was found to be vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as it did not throttle the framebuffer updates sent to its client. If the client did not consume these updates, VNC server allocates growing memory to hold onto this data. A malicious remote VNC client could use this flaw to cause DoS to the server host.(CVE-2017-15124)

Qemu through 2.10.0 allows remote attackers to cause a memory leak by triggering slow data-channel read operations, related to io/channel-websock.c.(CVE-2017-15268)

The vga_draw_text function in Qemu allows local OS guest privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and QEMU process crash) by leveraging improper memory address validation.(CVE-2018-5683)

An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639)

Quick Emulator (aka QEMU), when built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support, allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access and QEMU process crash) by leveraging incorrect region calculation when updating VGA display.(CVE-2018-7858)");
