It was found that the JAXP component of OpenJDK failed to correctly enforce parse tree size limits when parsing XML document. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted XML document could use this flaw to make it consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2017-3526)

It was discovered that the HTTP client implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK could cache and re-use an NTLM authenticated connection in a different security context. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a Java application perform HTTP requests authenticated with credentials of a different user. (CVE-2017-3509)

It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not allow users to restrict the set of algorithms allowed for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash algorithm. (CVE-2017-3539)

Newline injection flaws were discovered in FTP and SMTP client implementations in the Networking component in OpenJDK. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to manipulate FTP or SMTP connections established by a Java application. (CVE-2017-3533, CVE-2017-3544)");
