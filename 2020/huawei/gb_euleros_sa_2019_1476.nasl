  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A use-after-free vulnerability was found in DCCP socket code affecting the Linux kernel since 2.6.16. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to their escalate privileges.(CVE-2017-8824)

The OZWPAN driver in the Linux kernel through 4.0.5 relies on an untrusted length field during packet parsing, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) via a crafted packet.(CVE-2015-4004)

Integer signedness error in the MSM V4L2 video driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, allows attackers to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (array overflow and memory corruption) via a crafted application that triggers an msm_isp_axi_create_stream call.(CVE-2016-2061)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's XFS file system implementation ordered directory hashes under certain conditions. A local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the file system by creating directories with colliding hash values, potentially resulting in a system crash.(CVE-2014-7283)

It was found that the Linux kernel's ping socket implementation did not properly handle socket unhashing during spurious disconnects, which could lead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system. On non-x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2015-3636)

Incorrect buffer length handling was found in the ncp_read_kernel function in fs/ncpfs/ncplib_kernel.c in the Linux kernel, which could be exploited by malicious NCPFS servers to crash the kernel or possibly execute an arbitrary code.(CVE-2018-8822)

** DISPUTED ** Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) in the Linux kernel 2.6.32 through 4.x does not prevent use of a write-timing side channel, which allows guest OS users to defeat the ASLR protection mechanism on other guest OS instances via a Cross-VM ASL INtrospection (CAIN) attack. NOTE: the vendor states 'Basically if you care about this attack vector, disable deduplication.' Share-until-written approaches for memory conservation among mutually untrusting tenants are inherently detectable for information disclosure, and can be classified as potentially misunderstood behaviors rather than vulnerabilities.(CVE-2015-2877)

The tty_set_termios_ldisc() function in 'drivers/tty/tty_ldisc.c' in the Linux kernel before 4.5 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by reading a tty data structure.(CVE-2015-8964)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. vbg_misc_device_ioctl() in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_linux.c reads the same user data twice with copy_from_user. The header part ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
