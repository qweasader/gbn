  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A race condition between hugetlb sysctl handlers in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.8 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory, cause a NULL pointer dereference, or possibly have unspecified other impact, aka CID-17743798d812.(CVE-2020-25285)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.(CVE-2020-14386)

Insufficient input validation in i40e driver for Intel(R) Ethernet 700 Series Controllers versions before 7.0 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable a denial of service via local access.(CVE-2019-0147)

A TOCTOU mismatch in the NFS client code in the Linux kernel before 5.8.3 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory or possibly have unspecified other impact because a size check is in fs/ nfs/ nfs4proc.c instead of fs/ nfs/ nfs4xdr.c, aka CID-b4487b935452.(CVE-2020-25212)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. A failure of the file system metadata validator in XFS can cause an inode with a valid, user-creatable extended attribute to be flagged as corrupt. This can lead to the filesystem being shutdown, or otherwise rendered inaccessible until it is remounted, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-14385)

In uvc_scan_chain_forward of uvc_driver.c, there is a possible linked list corruption due to an unusual root cause. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-111893654References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2020-0404)

The rbd block device driver in drivers/block/rbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.8.9 used incomplete permission checking for access to rbd devices, which could be leveraged by local attackers to map or unmap rbd block devices, aka CID-f44d04e696fe.(CVE-2020-25284)

A memory out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc2 with the ext3/ext4 file system, in the way it accesses a directory with broken indexing. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system if the directory exists. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-14314)");
