  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A division-by-zero in set_termios(), when debugging is enabled, was found in the Linux kernel. When the [io_ti] driver is loaded, a local unprivileged attacker can request incorrect high transfer speed in the change_port_settings() in the drivers/usb/serial/io_ti.c so that the divisor value becomes zero and causes a system crash resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-18360)

Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time that permits access to a physical page after it has been released back to the page allocator and reused.(CVE-2018-18281)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's USB subsystem in the __usb_get_extra_descriptor() function in the drivers/usb/core/usb.c which mishandles a size check during the reading of an extra descriptor data. By using a specially crafted USB device which sends a forged extra descriptor, an unprivileged user with physical access to the system can potentially cause a privilege escalation or trigger a system crash or lock up and thus to cause a denial of service (DoS).(CVE-2018-20169)

It was found that the Linux kernel can hit a BUG_ON() statement in the __xfs_get_blocks() in the fs/xfs/xfs_aops.c because of a race condition between direct and memory-mapped I/O associated with a hole in a file that is handled with BUG_ON() instead of an I/O failure. This allows a local unprivileged attacker to cause a system crash and a denial of service.(CVE-2016-10741)

A use-after-free flaw can occur in the Linux kernel due to a race condition between packet_do_bind() and packet_notifier() functions called for an AF_PACKET socket. An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to an unresponsive system or to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. (CVE-2018-18559)

An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames. This is related to cgw_csum_xor_rel. An unprivileged user can trigger a system crash (general protection fault).(CVE-2019-3701)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause a use-after-free in ext4_xattr_set_entry function and a denial of service or unspecified other impact may occur by renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image.(CVE-2018-10879)
