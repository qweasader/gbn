  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"dbus 1.3.0 before 1.6.22 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6, when running on Linux 2.6.37-rc4 or later, allows local users to cause a denial of service (system-bus disconnect of other services or applications) by sending a message containing a file descriptor, then exceeding the maximum recursion depth before the initial message is forwarded.(CVE-2014-3532)

dbus 1.3.0 before 1.6.22 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (disconnect) via a certain sequence of crafted messages that cause the dbus-daemon to forward a message containing an invalid file descriptor.(CVE-2014-3533)

D-Bus 1.4.x through 1.6.x before 1.6.30, 1.8.x before 1.8.16, and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 does not validate the source of ActivationFailure signals, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (activation failure error returned) by leveraging a race condition involving sending an ActivationFailure signal before systemd responds.(CVE-2015-0245)

D-Bus 1.3.0 through 1.6.x before 1.6.24 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8 allows local users to (1) cause a denial of service (prevention of new connections and connection drop) by queuing the maximum number of file descriptors or (2) cause a denial of service (disconnect) via multiple messages that combine to have more than the allowed number of file descriptors for a single sendmsg call.(CVE-2014-3636)

The dbus-daemon in D-Bus 1.2.x through 1.4.x, 1.6.x before 1.6.20, and 1.8.x before 1.8.4, sends an AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the client is prohibited from accessing the service, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (initialization failure and exit) or possibly conduct a side-channel attack via a D-Bus message to an inactive service.(CVE-2014-3477)

D-Bus 1.3.0 through 1.6.x before 1.6.24 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8 does not properly close connections for processes that have terminated, which allows local users to cause a denial of service via a D-bus message containing a D-Bus connection file descriptor.(CVE-2014-3637)

Off-by-one error in D-Bus 1.3.0 through 1.6.x before 1.6.24 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8, when running on a 64-bit system and the max_message_unix_fds limit is set to an odd number, allows local users to cause a denial of service (dbus-daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by sending one more file descriptor than the limit, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow or an assertion failure.(CVE-2014-3635)

The bus_connections_check_reply function in config-parser.c in D-Bus before 1.6.24 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8 allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a large number of method calls.(CVE-2014-3638)

The dbus-daemon in D-Bus before 1.6.24 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8 does not properly close old connections, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (incomplete connection consumption and prevention of new connections) via a large number of ...
