  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, dissectors that support zlib decompression could crash. This was addressed in epan/tvbuff_zlib.c by rejecting negative lengths to avoid a buffer over-read.(CVE-2018-14340)

In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the DICOM dissector could go into a large or infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dcm.c by preventing an offset overflow.(CVE-2018-14341)

In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.3 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.11, the JSON, XML, NTP, XMPP, and GDB dissectors could crash. This was addressed in epan/tvbparse.c by limiting the recursion depth.(CVE-2018-5336)

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.12 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.4, the SIGCOMP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-sigcomp.c by correcting the extraction of the length value.(CVE-2018-7418)

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6, the ROS dissector could crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/asn1/ros/packet-ros-template.c by validating an OID.(CVE-2017-9347)

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.12, the DICOM dissector has an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dcm.c by validating a length value.(CVE-2017-9349)

In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the MMSE dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mmse.c by preventing length overflows.(CVE-2018-19622)

The dissect_dcom_OBJREF function in epan/dissectors/packet-dcom.c in the DCOM dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 does not initialize a certain IPv4 data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.(CVE-2015-8714)

In Wireshark 2.4.0, 2.2.0 to 2.2.8, and 2.0.0 to 2.0.14, the IrCOMM dissector has a buffer over-read and application crash. This was addressed in plugins/irda/packet-ircomm.c by adding length validation.(CVE-2017-13765)

In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.2 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.10, the NetBIOS dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-netbios.c by ensuring that write operations are bounded by the beginning of a buffer.(CVE-2017-17083)

The dissect_hsdsch_channel_info function in epan/dissectors/packet-umts_fp.c in the UMTS FP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 does not validate the number of PDUs, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.(CVE-2015-8712)

epan/dissectors/packet-umts_fp.c in the UMTS FP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 does not properly reserve memory for channel ID mappings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and application crash) via a crafted packet.(CVE-2015-8713)

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the IMAP dissector could crash, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
