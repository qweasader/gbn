  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4 allows a trusted peer to perform Denial of Service by consuming all available CPU cycles during handling of a crafted Cache Digest response message. This only occurs when cache_peer is used with the cache digests feature. The problem exists because peerDigestHandleReply() livelocking in peer_digest.cc mishandles EOF.(CVE-2020-24606)

An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag esi:when when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression while it's being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member, there is no check to ensure that the stack won't overflow.(CVE-2019-12519)

An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is parsing ESI, it keeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement. addStackElement has a check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it's off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can't affect adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing.(CVE-2019-12521)

An issue was discovered in Squid before 5.0.2. A remote attacker can replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden. This occurs because the attacker can overflow the nonce reference counter (a short integer). Remote code execution may occur if the pooled token credentials are freed (instead of replayed as valid credentials).(CVE-2020-11945)

An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. It allows a crafted FTP server to trigger disclosure of sensitive information from heap memory, such as information associated with other users' sessions or non-Squid processes.(CVE-2019-12528)

An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. Due to incorrect input validation, it can interpret crafted HTTP requests in unexpected ways to access server resources prohibited by earlier security filters.(CVE-2020-8449)

An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. Due to incorrect buffer management, a remote client can cause a buffer overflow in a Squid instance acting as a reverse proxy.(CVE-2020-8450)

An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. Due to incorrect input validation, the NTLM authentication credentials parser in ext_lm_group_acl may write to memory outside the credentials buffer. On systems with memory access protections, this can result in the helper process being terminated unexpectedly. This leads to the Squid process also terminating and a denial of service for all clients using the proxy.(CVE-2020-8517)");
