QEMU 4.1.0 has a memory leak in zrle_compress_data in ui/vnc-enc-zrle.c during a VNC disconnect operation because libz is misused, resulting in a situation where memory allocated in deflateInit2 is not freed in deflateEnd.(CVE-2019-20382)

An out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the USB emulator of the QEMU in versions before 5.2.0. This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice 'setup_len' exceeds its 'data_buf[4096]' in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.(CVE-2020-14364)

hw/net/xgmac.c in the XGMAC Ethernet controller in QEMU before 07-20-2020 has a buffer overflow. This occurs during packet transmission and affects the highbank and midway emulated machines. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential privileged code execution. This was fixed in commit 5519724a13664b43e225ca05351c60b4468e4555.(CVE-2020-15863)

The vmware-vga driver (hw/display/vmware_vga.c) in QEMU allows local guest users to write to qemu memory locations and gain privileges via unspecified parameters related to rectangle handling.(CVE-2014-3689)");
