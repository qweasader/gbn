  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the way OpenSSL decoded malformed Base64-encoded inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted Base64-encoded input (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application to crash. Note: this flaw is not exploitable via the TLS/SSL protocol because the data being transferred is not Base64-encoded.(CVE-2015-0292)

An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the X509_cmp_time() function of OpenSSL, which is used to test the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates. An attacker could possibly use a specially crafted SSL/TLS certificate or CRL (Certificate Revocation List), which when parsed by an application would cause that application to crash.(CVE-2015-1789)

A memory leak vulnerability was found in the way OpenSSL parsed PKCS#7 and CMS data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application that parses PKCS#7 or CMS data from untrusted sources to use an excessive amount of memory and possibly crash.(CVE-2015-3195)

OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted DTLS message that is processed with a different read operation for the handshake header than for the handshake body, related to the dtls1_get_record function in d1_pkt.c and the ssl3_read_n function in s3_pkt.c.(CVE-2014-3571)

OpenSSL through 1.0.2h incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, related to s3_srvr.c, ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c.(CVE-2016-2177)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the way the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application.(CVE-2016-2105)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the way the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application.(CVE-2016-2106)

A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library.(CVE-2016-2108)
