A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application.(CVE-2016-2106)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain ASN.1-encoded data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. An application using OpenSSL that accepts untrusted ASN.1 BIO input could be forced to allocate an excessive amount of data.(CVE-2016-2109)

The X509_cmp_time function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted length field in ASN1_TIME data, as demonstrated by an attack against a server that supports client authentication with a custom verification callback.(CVE-2015-1789)");
