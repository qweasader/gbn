  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the invert video code on VGA consoles when a local attacker attempts to resize the console, calling an ioctl VT_RESIZE, which causes an out-of-bounds write to occur. This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-14331)

A flaw was found in the HDLC_PPP module of the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc7. Memory corruption and a read overflow is caused by improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr function which can cause the system to crash or cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-25643)

A memory out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc2 with the ext3/ext4 file system, in the way it accesses a directory with broken indexing. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system if the directory exists. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-14314)

A TOCTOU mismatch in the NFS client code in the Linux kernel before 5.8.3 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory or possibly have unspecified other impact because a size check is in fs/ nfs/ nfs4proc.c instead of fs/ nfs/ nfs4xdr.c, aka CID-b4487b935452.(CVE-2020-25212)

The rbd block device driver in drivers/block/rbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.8.9 used incomplete permission checking for access to rbd devices, which could be leveraged by local attackers to map or unmap rbd block devices, aka CID-f44d04e696fe.(CVE-2020-25284)

A race condition between hugetlb sysctl handlers in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.8 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory, cause a NULL pointer dereference, or possibly have unspecified other impact, aka CID-17743798d812.(CVE-2020-25285)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.(CVE-2020-14386)

In the Linux kernel through 5.8.7, local attackers able to inject conntrack netlink configuration could overflow a local buffer, causing crashes or triggering use of incorrect protocol numbers in ctnetlink_parse_tuple_filter in net/ netfilter/ nf_conntrack_netlink.c, aka CID-1cc5ef91d2ff.(CVE-2020-25211)

The VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel through 5.6.13 mishandles attempts to access disabled memory space.(CVE-2020-12888)

The kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and MRG-2 does not clear garbage data for SG_IO buffer, which may leaking sensitive information to userspace.(CVE-2014-8181)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels SELinux ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
