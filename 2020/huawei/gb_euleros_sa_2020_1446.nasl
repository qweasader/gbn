Directory traversal vulnerability in GNU patch versions which support Git-style patching before 2.7.3 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files with the permissions of the target user via a .. (dot dot) in a diff file name.(CVE-2015-1395)

An issue was discovered in GNU patch before 2.7.6. Out-of-bounds access within pch_write_line() in pch.c can possibly lead to DoS via a crafted input file.(CVE-2016-10713)

GNU patch 2.7.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and segmentation fault) via a crafted diff file.(CVE-2014-9637)

GNU patch 2.7.1 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a symlink attack in a patch file.(CVE-2015-1196)

GNU patch through 2.7.6 is vulnerable to OS shell command injection that can be exploited by opening a crafted patch file that contains an ed style diff payload with shell metacharacters. The ed editor does not need to be present on the vulnerable system. This is different from CVE-2018-1000156.(CVE-2019-13638)

do_ed_script in pch.c in GNU patch through 2.7.6 does not block strings beginning with a ! character. NOTE: this is the same commit as for CVE-2019-13638, but the ! syntax is specific to ed, and is unrelated to a shell metacharacter.(CVE-2018-20969)");
