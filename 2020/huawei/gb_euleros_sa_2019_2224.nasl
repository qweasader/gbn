  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"poppler through version 0.55.0 is vulnerable to an uncontrolled recursion in pdfunite resulting into potential denial-of-service.(CVE-2017-7515)

An issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a reachable abort in Object.h, will lead to denial of service because EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc lacks a stream check before saving an embedded file.(CVE-2018-19058)

An issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a out-of-bounds read in EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc, will lead to denial of service, as demonstrated by utils/pdfdetach.cc not validating embedded files before save attempts.(CVE-2018-19059)

An issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a NULL pointer dereference in goo/GooString.h, will lead to denial of service, as demonstrated by utils/pdfdetach.cc not validating a filename of an embedded file before constructing a save path.(CVE-2018-19060)

Poppler before 0.70.0 has a NULL pointer dereference in _poppler_attachment_new when called from poppler_annot_file_attachment_get_attachment.(CVE-2018-19149)

A reachable Object::dictLookup assertion in Poppler 0.72.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service due to the lack of a check for the dict data type, as demonstrated by use of the FileSpec class (in FileSpec.cc) in pdfdetach.(CVE-2018-20650)

In Poppler 0.68.0, the Parser::getObj() function in Parser.cc may cause infinite recursion via a crafted file. A remote attacker can leverage this for a DoS attack.(CVE-2018-16646)

An issue was discovered in Poppler 0.71.0. There is a memory leak in GfxColorSpace::setDisplayProfile in GfxState.cc, as demonstrated by pdftocairo.(CVE-2018-18897)

In Poppler 0.72.0, PDFDoc::setup in PDFDoc.cc allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash caused by Object.h SIGABRT, because of a wrong return value from PDFDoc::setup) by crafting a PDF file in which an xref data structure is mishandled during extractPDFSubtype processing.(CVE-2018-20662)");
