An issue was discovered in the hwpoison implementation in mm/memory-failure.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.4. When soft_offline_in_use_page() runs on a thp tail page after pmd is split, an attacker can cause a denial of service (BUG).(CVE-2019-10124)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's early load microcode functionality. On a system with UEFI Secure Boot enabled, a local, privileged user could use this flaw to increase their privileges to the kernel (ring0) level, bypassing intended restrictions in place.(CVE-2015-2666)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking subsystem handled offloaded packets with multiple layers of encapsulation in the GRO (Generic Receive Offload) code path. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger unbounded recursion in the kernel that could lead to stack corruption, resulting in a system crash.(CVE-2016-8666)

The ethtool_get_wol function in net/core/ethtool.c in the Linux kernel through 4.7, as used in Android before 2016-08-05 on Nexus 5 and 7 (2013) devices, does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via a crafted application, aka Android internal bug 28803952 and Qualcomm internal bug CR570754.(CVE-2014-9900)

A vulnerability was found in crypto/ahash.c in the Linux kernel which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (API operation calling its own callback, and infinite recursion) by triggering EBUSY on a full queue.(CVE-2017-7618)

drivers/misc/qseecom.c in the QSEECOM driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not validate certain offset, length, and base values within an ioctl call, which allows attackers to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted application.(CVE-2014-4322)

An integer overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in xt_alloc_table_info, which on 32-bit systems can lead to small structure allocation and a copy_from_user based heap corruption.(CVE-2016-3135)

Stack-based buffer overflow in the supply_lm_input_write function in drivers/thermal/supply_lm_core.c in the MSM Thermal driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that sends a large amount of data through the debugfs interface.(CVE-2016-2063)

The l2tp_ip_recvmsg function in net/l2tp/l2tp_ip.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.4 updates a certain length value before ensuring that an associated data structure has been initialized, which allows local users to obtain ...
