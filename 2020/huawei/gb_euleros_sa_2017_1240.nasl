A heap buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq in the IPv6 router advertisement (RA) handling code. An attacker on the local network segment could send crafted RAs to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected configurations using one of these options: enable-ra, ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-advrouter, or ra-stateless. (CVE-2017-14492)

A stack buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 code. An attacker on the local network could send a crafted DHCPv6 request to dnsmasq which would cause it to a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14493)

An information leak was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 relay code. An attacker on the local network could send crafted DHCPv6 packets to dnsmasq causing it to forward the contents of process memory, potentially leaking sensitive data. (CVE-2017-14494)");
