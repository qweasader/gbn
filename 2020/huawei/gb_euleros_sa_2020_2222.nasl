NOTE: the affected function was renamed to vhost_scsi_make_tpg before the vulnerability was announced.(CVE-2015-4036)

The ecryptfs_privileged_open function in fs/ecryptfs/kthread.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.3 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (stack memory consumption) via vectors involving crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames, leading to recursive pagefault handling.(CVE-2016-1583)

It was found that SCSI driver in the Linux kernel can improperly access userspace memory outside the provided buffer. A local privileged attacker could potentially use this flaw to expose information from the kernel memory.(CVE-2017-13168)

The acpi_ds_create_operands() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/dsutils.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.(CVE-2017-13693)

The acpi_ps_complete_final_op() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/psobject.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the node and node_ext caches and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.(CVE-2017-13694)

The acpi_ns_evaluate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nseval.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.(CVE-2017-13695)

The XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE macro in fs/xfs/xfs_linux.h in the Linux kernel before 4.13.2 does not verify that a filesystem has a realtime device, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via vectors related to setting an RHINHERIT flag on a directory.(CVE-2017-14340)

The xfs_bmap_extents_to_btree function in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_bmap.c in the Linux kernel through 4.16.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (xfs_bmapi_write NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted xfs image.(CVE-2018-10323)

A flaw was found in Linux kernel in the ext4 filesystem code. A use-after-free is possible in ext4_ext_remove_space() function when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image.(CVE-2018-10876)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel ext4 filesystem. An out-of-bound access is possible in the ext4_ext_drop_refs() function when operating on ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
