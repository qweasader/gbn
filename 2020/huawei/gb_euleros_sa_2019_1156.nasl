  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.19. An information leak in cdrom_ioctl_select_disc in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c could be used by local attackers to read kernel memory because a cast from unsigned long to int interferes with bounds checking. This is similar to CVE-2018-10940 and CVE-2018-16658.(CVE-2018-18710)

A flaw was found in mmap in the Linux kernel allowing the process to map a null page. This allows attackers to abuse this mechanism to turn null pointer dereferences into workable exploits.(CVE-2019-9213)

The Linux kernel does not properly initialize memory in messages passed between virtual guests and the host operating system in the vhost/vhost.c:vhost_new_msg() function. This can allow local privileged users to read some kernel memory contents when reading from the /dev/vhost-net device file.(CVE-2018-1118)

It was found that the raw midi kernel driver does not protect against concurrent access which leads to a double realloc (double free) in snd_rawmidi_input_params() and snd_rawmidi_output_status() which are part of snd_rawmidi_ioctl() handler in rawmidi.c file. A malicious local attacker could possibly use this for privilege escalation.(CVE-2018-10902)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's USB subsystem in the __usb_get_extra_descriptor() function in the drivers/usb/core/usb.c which mishandles a size check during the reading of an extra descriptor data. By using a specially crafted USB device which sends a forged extra descriptor, an unprivileged user with physical access to the system can potentially cause a privilege escalation or trigger a system crash or lock up and thus to cause a denial of service (DoS).(CVE-2018-20169)

In the function wmi_set_ie() in the Linux kernel the length validation code does not handle unsigned integer overflow properly. As a result, a large value of the '~ie_len' argument can cause a buffer overflow and thus a memory corruption leading to a system crash or other or unspecified impact. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.(CVE-2018-5848)

A new software page cache side channel attack scenario was discovered in operating systems that implement the very common 'page cache' caching mechanism. A malicious user/process could use 'in memory' page-cache knowledge to infer access timings to shared memory and gain knowledge which can be used to reduce effectiveness of cryptographic strength by monitoring algorithmic behavior, infer access patterns of memory to determine code paths taken, and exfiltrate data to a blinded attacker through page-granularity access times as a side-channel.(CVE-2019-5489)

A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in a way that the cleancache subsystem clears an inode after the final file truncation (removal). The new file created with the same inode may contain leftover pages from cleancache and the old file data instead of the new one.(CVE-2018-16862)");
