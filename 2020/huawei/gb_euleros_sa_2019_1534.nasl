fs/f2fs/segment.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) by using a noflush_merge option that triggers a NULL value for a flush_cmd_control data structure.(CVE-2017-18241)

fs/pnode.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5.4 does not properly traverse a mount propagation tree in a certain case involving a slave mount, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted series of mount system calls.(CVE-2016-4581)

drivers/vhost/net.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13.10, when mergeable buffers are disabled, does not properly validate packet lengths, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and host OS crash) or possibly gain privileges on the host OS via crafted packets, related to the handle_rx and get_rx_bufs functions.(CVE-2014-0077)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2016-9576 was incomplete: the Linux kernel's sg implementation did not properly restrict write operations in situations where the KERNEL_DS option is set. A local attacker to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging write access to a /dev/sg device.(CVE-2016-10088)

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. Since the page allocator does not yield CPU resources to the owner of the oom_lock mutex, a local unprivileged user can trivially lock up the system forever by wasting CPU resources from the page allocator (e.g., via concurrent page fault events) when the global OOM killer is invoked. NOTE: the software maintainer has not accepted certain proposed patches, in part because of a viewpoint that 'the underlying problem is non-trivial to handle.'(CVE-2016-10723)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ASN.1 DER decoder processed certain certificate files with tags of indefinite length. A local, unprivileged user could use a specially crafted X.509 certificate DER file to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2016-0758)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled the association's output queue. A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets that would cause the system to use an excessive amount of memory, leading to a denial of service.(CVE-2014-3688)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the ping_init_sock() function of the Linux kernel handled the group_info reference counter. A local, ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
