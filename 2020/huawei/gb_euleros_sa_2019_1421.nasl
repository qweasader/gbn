The png_handle_sCAL function in pngrutil.c in libpng 1.0.x before 1.0.55, 1.2.x before 1.2.45, 1.4.x before 1.4.8, and 1.5.x before 1.5.4 does not properly handle invalid sCAL chunks, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PNG image that triggers the reading of uninitialized memory.(CVE-2011-2692)

It was discovered that the png_get_PLTE() and png_set_PLTE() functions of libpng did not correctly calculate the maximum palette sizes for bit depths of less than 8. In case an application tried to use these functions in combination with properly calculated palette sizes, this could lead to a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could exploit this to cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking an unsuspecting user into processing a specially crafted PNG image. However, the exact impact is dependent on the application using the library.(CVE-2015-8472)

The png_err function in pngerror.c in libpng 1.0.x before 1.0.55, 1.2.x before 1.2.45, 1.4.x before 1.4.8, and 1.5.x before 1.5.4 makes a function call using a NULL pointer argument instead of an empty-string argument, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted PNG image.(CVE-2011-2691)

Integer underflow in the png_check_keyword function in pngwutil.c in libpng 0.90 through 0.99, 1.0.x before 1.0.66, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.56, 1.3.x and 1.4.x before 1.4.19, and 1.5.x before 1.5.26 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a space character as a keyword in a PNG image, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.(CVE-2015-8540)

Integer overflow in libpng, as used in Google Chrome before 17.0.963.56, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that trigger an integer truncation.(CVE-2011-3026)

An array-indexing error was discovered in the png_convert_to_rfc1123() function of libpng. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause an out-of-bounds read by tricking an unsuspecting user into processing a specially crafted PNG image.(CVE-2015-7981)

Buffer overflow in libpng 1.0.x before 1.0.55, 1.2.x before 1.2.45, 1.4.x before 1.4.8, and 1.5.x before 1.5.4, when used by an application that calls the png_rgb_to_gray function but not the png_set_expand function, allows remote attackers to overwrite memory with an arbitrary amount of data, and possibly have ...
