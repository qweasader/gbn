PCRE before 8.38 mishandles the : and \\\\ substrings in character classes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.(CVE-2015-8390)

Heap-based buffer overflow in the find_fixedlength function in pcre_compile.c in PCRE before 8.38 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or obtain sensitive information from heap memory and possibly bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted regular expression with an excess closing parenthesis.(CVE-2015-5073)

PCRE before 8.38 mishandles (?123) subroutine calls and related subroutine calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.(CVE-2015-8387)

The pcre_compile function in pcre_compile.c in PCRE before 8.38 mishandles certain : nesting, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.(CVE-2015-8391)
