  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was discovered that the ghostscript .tempfile function did not properly handle file permissions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and delete files or disclose their content via a specially crafted PostScript document.(CVE-2018-15908)

It was discovered that the ghostscript .shfill operator did not properly validate certain types. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.(CVE-2018-15909)

It was discovered that ghostscript did not properly verify the key used in aesdecode. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.(CVE-2018-15911)

It was discovered that the ghostscript .type operator did not properly validate its operands. A specially crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the ghostscript process.(CVE-2018-16511)

It was discovered that the ghostscript did not properly restrict access to files open prior to enabling the -dSAFER mode. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and disclose the content of affected files via a specially crafted PostScript document.(CVE-2018-16539)

It was discovered that the ghostscript device cleanup did not properly handle devices replaced with a null device. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.(CVE-2018-16541)

An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.25. Incorrect 'restoration of privilege' checking when running out of stack during exception handling could be used by attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to execute code using the 'pipe' instruction. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-16509.(CVE-2018-16802)

It was found that RHSA-2018:2918 did not fully fix CVE-2018-16509. An attacker could possibly exploit another variant of the flaw and bypass the -dSAFER protection to, for example, execute arbitrary shell commands via a specially crafted PostScript document.(CVE-2018-16863)

Artifex Ghostscript before 9.25 allowed a user-writable error exception table, which could be used by remote attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to potentially overwrite or replace error handlers to inject code.(CVE-2018-17183)

Artifex Ghostscript 9.25 and earlier allows attackers to bypass a sandbox protection mechanism via vectors involving errorhandler setup. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-17183.(CVE-2018-17961)
