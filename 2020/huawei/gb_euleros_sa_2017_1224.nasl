An integer overflow flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in the CCID Card device support. The flaw could occur while passing messages via command/response packets to and from the host. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-5898)

An information exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory. (CVE-2016-4020)

Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with the Network Block Device (NBD) Server support is vulnerable to a crash via a SIGPIPE signal. The crash can occur if a client aborts a connection due to any failure during negotiation or read operation. A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in a DoS.
