et/tun.c in the Linux kernel through 3.11.1 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability and providing an invalid tuntap interface name in a TUNSETIFF ioctl call.(CVE-2013-4343)

It was found that when the gcc stack protector was enabled, reading the /proc/keys file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to stack corruption. This happened because an incorrect buffer size was used to hold a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks.(CVE-2016-7042)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel that fs/ocfs2/aops.c omits use of a semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode. This allows local users to cause a denial of service by modifying a certain e_cpos field.(CVE-2017-18224)

The sctp_v6_create_accept_sk function in net/sctp/ipv6.c in the Linux kernel mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to CVE-2017-8890. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.(CVE-2017-9075)

In the function sbusfb_ioctl_helper() in drivers/video/fbdev/sbuslib.c in the Linux kernel, up to and including 4.15, an integer signedness error allows arbitrary information leakage for the FBIOPUTCMAP_SPARC and FBIOGETCMAP_SPARC commands.(CVE-2018-6412)

A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mmap(2), madvise(2), and fallocate(2) system calls interacted with each other while operating on virtual memory file system files. A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.(CVE-2014-4171)

** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.(CVE-2018-1095)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled simultaneous connections between the same hosts. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2014-5077)

A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not.(CVE-2018-13405)
