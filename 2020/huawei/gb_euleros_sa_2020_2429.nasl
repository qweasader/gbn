A flaw was found in the HDLC_PPP module of the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc7. Memory corruption and a read overflow is caused by improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr function which can cause the system to crash or cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-25643)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc7. Traffic between two Geneve endpoints may be unencrypted when IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel allowing anyone between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2020-25645)

An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack implementation handled initialization of stack memory when handling certain AMP packets. A remote attacker in adjacent range could use this flaw to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending a specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2020-12352)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel Bluetooth implementation handled L2CAP packets with A2MP CID. A remote attacker in adjacent range could use this flaw to crash the system causing denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-12351)

A missing CAP_NET_RAW check in NFC socket creation in net/nfc/rawsock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.2 could be used by local attackers to create raw sockets, bypassing security mechanisms, aka CID-26896f01467a.(CVE-2020-26088)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of biovecs in versions before 5.9-rc7. A zero-length biovec request issued by the block subsystem could cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, causing a denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with basic privileges to issue requests to a block device, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-25641)
