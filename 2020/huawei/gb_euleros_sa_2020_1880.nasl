  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"tftp.c in libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, does not prevent ..\ directory traversal on Windows.(CVE-2020-7211)

interface_release_resource in hw/display/qxl.c in QEMU 4.0.0 has a NULL pointer dereference.(CVE-2019-12155)

QEMU 3.0.0 has an Integer Overflow because the qga/commands*.c files do not check the length of the argument list or the number of environment variables. NOTE: This has been disputed as not exploitable.(CVE-2019-12247)

qemu-bridge-helper.c in QEMU 4.0.0 does not ensure that a network interface name (obtained from bridge.conf or a --br=bridge option) is limited to the IFNAMSIZ size, which can lead to an ACL bypass.(CVE-2019-13164)

ip_reass in ip_input.c in libslirp 4.0.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a large packet because it mishandles a case involving the first fragment.(CVE-2019-14378)

An issue was discovered in ide_dma_cb() in hw/ide/core.c in QEMU 2.4.0 through 4.2.0. The guest system can crash the QEMU process in the host system via a special SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND. It hits an assertion that implies that the size of successful DMA transfers there must be a multiple of 512 (the size of a sector). NOTE: a member of the QEMU security team disputes the significance of this issue because a 'privileged guest user has many ways to cause similar DoS effect, without triggering this assert.'(CVE-2019-20175)

hw/sparc64/sun4u.c in QEMU 3.1.50 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference, which allows the attacker to cause a denial of service via a device driver.(CVE-2019-5008)

An OOB heap buffer r/w access issue was found in the NVM Express Controller emulation in QEMU. It could occur in nvme_cmb_ops routines in nvme device. A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS or potentially run arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process.(CVE-2018-16847)

hw/rdma/vmw/pvrdma_cmd.c in QEMU allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference or excessive memory allocation) in create_cq_ring or create_qp_rings.(CVE-2018-20125)

QEMU can have an infinite loop in hw/rdma/vmw/pvrdma_dev_ring.c because return values are not checked (and -1 is mishandled).(CVE-2018-20216)

The load_multiboot function in hw/i386/multiboot.c in Quick Emulator (aka QEMU) allows local guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the QEMU host via a mh_load_end_addr value greater than mh_bss_end_addr, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write memory access.(CVE-2018-7550)");
