Session fixation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.66, 8.x before 8.0.30, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M2, when different session settings are used for deployments of multiple versions of the same web application, might allow remote attackers to hijack web sessions by leveraging use of a requestedSessionSSL field for an unintended request, related to CoyoteAdapter.java and Request.java.(CVE-2015-5346)

Apache Tomcat through 8.5.4, when the CGI Servlet is enabled, follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an 'httpoxy' issue. NOTE: the vendor states 'A mitigation is planned for future releases of Tomcat, tracked as CVE-2016-5388', in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.(CVE-2016-5388)

It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed configuration file /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.(CVE-2016-5425)
