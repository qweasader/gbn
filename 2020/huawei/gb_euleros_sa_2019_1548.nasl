  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A race condition was found in the session handling code of OpenSSL. This issue could possibly cause a multi-threaded TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL to double free session ticket data and crash.(CVE-2015-1791)

An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the X509_cmp_time() function of OpenSSL, which is used to test the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates. An attacker could possibly use a specially crafted SSL/TLS certificate or CRL (Certificate Revocation List), which when parsed by an application would cause that application to crash.(CVE-2015-1789)

The ASN1_STRING_print_ex function in OpenSSL before 0.9.8k allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and application crash) via vectors that trigger printing of a (1) BMPString or (2) UniversalString with an invalid encoded length.(CVE-2009-0590)

An invalid-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain DTLS handshake messages. A malicious DTLS client or server could send a specially crafted message to the peer, which could cause the application to crash or potentially result in arbitrary code execution.(CVE-2014-8176)

The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f performs a MAC check only if certain padding is valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers to recover plaintext via a padding oracle attack.(CVE-2011-4108)

Off-by-one error in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function in OpenSSL 0.9.7 up to 0.9.7l, and 0.9.8 up to 0.9.8f, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet that triggers a one-byte buffer underflow. NOTE: this issue was introduced as a result of a fix for CVE-2006-3738. As of 20071012, it is unknown whether code execution is possible.(CVE-2007-5135)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the DTLS implementation of OpenSSL. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted DTLS message, which would cause an OpenSSL server to crash.(CVE-2014-3571)

The asn1_d2i_read_bio function in crypto/asn1/a_d2i_fp.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8v, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0i, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1a does not properly interpret integer data, which allows remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks, and cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact, via crafted DER data, as demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an RSA public key.(CVE-2012-2110)

It was discovered that the SSLv2 servers using OpenSSL accepted SSLv2 connection handshakes that indicated non-zero clear key length for non-export cipher suites. An attacker could use this flaw to decrypt recorded SSLv2 sessions with the server by using it as a decryption oracle.(CVE-2016-0703)

ssl/s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8i allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a DTLS ChangeCipherSpec packet that occurs before ClientHello.(CVE-2009-1386)
