  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation validated INIT chunks when performing Address Configuration Change (ASCONF). A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system by sending a specially crafted SCTP packet to trigger a NULL pointer dereference on the system.(CVE-2014-7841)

It was found that reporting emulation failures to user space could lead to either a local (CVE-2014-7842) or a L2->L1 (CVE-2010-5313) denial of service. In the case of a local denial of service, an attacker must have access to the MMIO area or be able to access an I/O port. Please note that on certain systems, HPET is mapped to userspace as part of vdso (vvar) and thus an unprivileged user may generate MMIO transactions (and enter the emulator) this way.(CVE-2014-7842)

The pivot_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 does not properly interact with certain locations of a chroot directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop) via . (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot_root system call.(CVE-2014-7970)

The do_umount function in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 does not require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for do_remount_sb calls that change the root filesystem to read-only, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (loss of writability) by making certain unshare system calls, clearing the / MNT_LOCKED flag, and making an MNT_FORCE umount system call.(CVE-2014-7975)

A race condition flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 file system implementation that allowed a local, unprivileged user to crash the system by simultaneously writing to a file and toggling the O_DIRECT flag using fcntl(F_SETFL) on that file.(CVE-2014-8086)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem handled generic protocol tracking. As demonstrated in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) case, a remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended iptables rule restrictions when the associated connection tracking module was not loaded on the system.(CVE-2014-8160)

It was found that due to excessive files_lock locking, a soft lockup could be triggered in the Linux kernel when performing asynchronous I/O operations. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2014-8172)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's madvise MADV_WILLNEED functionality handled page table locking. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2014-8173)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-3601 was incomplete: the Linux kernel's kvm_iommu_map_pages() function still handled IOMMU mapping failures incorrectly. A privileged user in a guest with an assigned host device could use this flaw to crash the host.(CVE-2014-8369)
