  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The Linux kernel through 5.7.11 allows remote attackers to make observations that help to obtain sensitive information about the internal state of the network RNG, aka CID-f227e3ec3b5c. This is related to drivers/char/random.c and kernel/time/timer.c.(CVE-2020-16166)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the invert video code on VGA consoles when a local attacker attempts to resize the console, calling an ioctl VT_RESIZE, which causes an out-of-bounds write to occur. This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-14331)

A buffer over-read flaw was found in RH kernel versions before 5.0 in crypto_authenc_extractkeys in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec Cryptographic algorithm's module, authenc. When a payload longer than 4 bytes, and is not following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines, it causes a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a denial of service.(CVE-2020-10769)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.7.1. drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c has an integer overflow if k_ascii is called several times in a row, aka CID-b86dab054059. NOTE: Members in the community argue that the integer overflow does not lead to a security issue in this case.(CVE-2020-13974)

In the Linux kernel through 5.7.6, usbtest_disconnect in drivers/usb/misc/usbtest.c has a memory leak, aka CID-28ebeb8db770.(CVE-2020-15393)

The VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel through 5.6.13 mishandles attempts to access disabled memory space.(CVE-2020-12888)

go7007_snd_init in drivers/media/usb/go7007/snd-go7007.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6 does not call snd_card_free for a failure path, which causes a memory leak, aka CID-9453264ef586.(CVE-2019-20810)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.6. In rx_queue_add_kobject() and netdev_queue_add_kobject() in net/core/net-sysfs.c, a reference count is mishandled, aka CID-a3e23f719f5c.(CVE-2019-20811)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.4.7. The prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo() function in net/packet/af_packet.c can result in a denial of service (CPU consumption and soft lockup) in a certain failure case involving TPACKET_V3, aka CID-b43d1f9f7067.(CVE-2019-20812)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of Userspace core dumps. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to crash a trivial program and exfiltrate private kernel data.(CVE-2020-10732)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels SELinux LSM hook implementation before version 5.7, where it incorrectly assumed that an skb would only contain a single netlink message. The hook would incorrectly only validate the first netlink message in the skb ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
