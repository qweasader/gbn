the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test
Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on
a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain
administrative privileges. (CVE-2019-18683)

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not
properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An
attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when
mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-18885)

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel
did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory
exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19071)

It was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error
conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of
service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19077)

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in
the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error
conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of
service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19078)

It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router TUN device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A
local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel
memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19079)

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did
not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local
attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel
memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19082)

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the
Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a
NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19227)

Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A
local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or have other unspecified impacts. (CVE-2019-19252)
