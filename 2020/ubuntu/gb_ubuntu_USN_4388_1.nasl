kernel did not properly perform bounds checking on xattrs in some

It was discovered that memory contents previously stored in
microarchitectural special registers after RDRAND, RDSEED, and SGX EGETKEY
read operations on Intel client and Xeon E3 processors may be briefly
exposed to processes on the same or different processor cores. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-0543)

Piotr Krysiuk discovered that race conditions existed in the file system
implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12114)

It was discovered that the USB susbsystem's scatter-gather implementation
in the Linux kernel did not properly take data references in some
situations, leading to a use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12464)

Bui Quang Minh discovered that the XDP socket implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate meta-data passed from user space, leading
to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker with the
CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12659)

not properly encrypt IPv6 traffic in some situations. An attacker could use
