  dracut-saltboot:

  - Print a list of available disk devices (bsc#1170824)

  - Install wipefs to initrd

  - Force install crypt modules

  golang-github-prometheus-prometheus:

  - Update change log and spec file
  + Modified spec file: default to golang 1.14 to avoid 'have choice'
  build issues in OBS.
  + Rebase and update patches for version 2.18.0

  - Update to 2.18.0
  + Features

  * Tracing: Added experimental Jaeger support #7148
  + Changes

  * Federation: Only use local TSDB for federation (ignore remote read).
  #7096

  * Rules: `rule_evaluations_total` and `rule_evaluation_failures_total`
  have a `rule_group` label now. #7094
  + Enhancements

  * TSDB: Significantly reduce WAL size kept around after a block cut.
  #7098

  * Discovery: Add `architecture` meta label for EC2. #7000
  + Bug fixes

  * UI: Fixed wrong MinTime reported by /status. #7182

  * React UI: Fixed multiselect legend on OSX. #6880

  * Remote Write: Fixed blocked resharding edge case. #7122

  * Remote Write: Fixed remote write not updating on relabel configs
  change. #7073

  - Changes from 2.17.2
  + Bug fixes

  * Federation: Register federation metrics #7081

  * PromQL: Fix panic in parser error handling #7132

  * Rules: Fix reloads hanging when deleting a rule group that is being
  evaluated #7138

  * TSDB: Fix a memory leak when prometheus starts with an empty TSDB
  WAL #7135

  * TSDB: Make isolation more robust to panics in web handlers #7129
  #7136

  - Changes from 2.17.1
  + Bug fixes

  * TSDB: Fix query performance regression that increased memory and CPU
  usage #7051

  - Changes from 2.17.0
  + Features

  * TSDB: Support isolation #6841

  * This release implements isolation in TSDB. API queries and recording
  rules are guaranteed to only see full scrapes and full recording
  rules. This comes with a certain overhead in resource usage.
  Depending on the situation, there might be some increase in memory
  usage, CPU usage, or query latency.
  + Enhancements

  * PromQL: Allow more keywords as metric names #6933

  * React UI: Add normalization of localhost URLs in targets page #6794

  * Remote read: Read from remote storage concurrently #6770

  * Rules: Mark deleted rule series as stale after a reload #6745

  * Scrape: Log scrape append failures as debug rather than warn #6852

  * TSDB: Improve query performance for queries that partially hit the
  head #6676

  * Consul SD: Expose service health as meta label #5313

  * EC2 SD: Expose EC2 instance lifecycle as meta label #6914

  * Kubernetes SD: Expose service type as meta label for K8s service
  role #6684
