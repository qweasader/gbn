  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for conmon, fuse-overlayfs, libcontainers-common, podman fixes
  the following issues:

  podman was updated to v2.0.6 (bsc#1175821)

  - install missing systemd units for the new Rest API (bsc#1175957) and a
  few man-pages that where missing before

  - Drop varlink API related bits (in favor of the new API)

  - fix install location for zsh completions

  * Fixed a bug where running systemd in a container on a cgroups v1 system
  would fail.

  * Fixed a bug where /etc/passwd could be re-created every time a
  container is restarted if the container's /etc/passwd did not contain
  an entry for the user the container was started as.

  * Fixed a bug where containers without an /etc/passwd file specifying a
  non-root user would not start.

  * Fixed a bug where the --remote flag would sometimes not make remote
  connections and would instead attempt to run Podman locally.

  Update to v2.0.6:

  * Features

  - Rootless Podman will now add an entry to /etc/passwd for the user who
  ran Podman if run with --userns=keep-id.

  - The podman system connection command has been reworked to support
  multiple connections, and re-enabled for use!

  - Podman now has a new global flag, --connection, to specify a
  connection to a remote Podman API instance.

  * Changes

  - Podman's automatic systemd integration (activated by the

  - -systemd=true flag, set by default) will now activate for containers
  using /usr/local/sbin/init as their command, instead of just
  /usr/sbin/init and /sbin/init (and any path ending in systemd).

  - Seccomp profiles specified by the --security-opt seccomp=... flag to
  podman create and podman run will now be honored even if the container
  was created using --privileged.

  * Bugfixes

  - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube would not honor the hostIP
  field for port forwarding (#5964).

  - Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd command would panic on
  an invalid restart policy being specified (#7271).

  - Fixed a bug where the podman images command could take a very long
  time (several minutes) to complete when a large number of images were
  present.

  - Fixed a bug where the podman logs command with the --tail flag would
  not work properly when a large amount of output would be printed

  - Fixed a bug where the podman exec command with remote Podman would not
  return a non-zero exit code when the exec session failed to start
  (e.g. invoking a non-existent command) (#6893).

  - Fixed a bug where the podman load command with remote Podma ...
