  - CVE-2019-10879: An integer overflow in CDataFileReader::Open() could
  have lead to a buffer overflow and possibly remote code execution,
  because size-related multiplications were mishandled. (boo#1131729)

  - CVE-2019-10878: A failed bounds check in CDataFileReader::GetData() and
  CDataFileReader::ReplaceData() and related functions could have lead to
  an arbitrary free and out-of-bounds pointer write, possibly resulting in
  remote code execution.

  - CVE-2019-10877: An integer overflow in CMap::Load() could have lead to a
  buffer overflow, because multiplication of width and height were
  mishandled.

  - CVE-2018-18541: Connection packets could have been forged. There was no
  challenge-response involved in the connection build up. A remote
  attacker could have sent connection packets from a spoofed IP address
  and occupy all server slots, or even use them for a reflection attack
  using map download packets. (boo#1112910)
