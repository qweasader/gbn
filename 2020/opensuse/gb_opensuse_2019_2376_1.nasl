  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for procps fixes the following issues:

  procps was updated to 3.3.15. (bsc#1092100)

  Following security issues were fixed:

  - CVE-2018-1122: Prevent local privilege escalation in top. If a user ran
  top with HOME unset in an attacker-controlled directory, the attacker
  could have achieved privilege escalation by exploiting one of several
  vulnerabilities in the config_file() function (bsc#1092100).

  - CVE-2018-1123: Prevent denial of service in ps via mmap buffer overflow.
  Inbuilt protection in ps mapped a guard page at the end of the overflowed
  buffer, ensuring that the impact of this flaw is limited to a crash
  (temporary denial of service) (bsc#1092100).

  - CVE-2018-1124: Prevent multiple integer overflows leading to a heap
  corruption in file2strvec function. This allowed a privilege escalation
  for a local attacker who can create entries in procfs by starting
  processes, which could result in crashes or arbitrary code execution in
  proc utilities run by
  other users (bsc#1092100).

  - CVE-2018-1125: Prevent stack buffer overflow in pgrep. This
  vulnerability was mitigated by FORTIFY limiting the impact to a crash
  (bsc#1092100).

  - CVE-2018-1126: Ensure correct integer size in proc/alloc.* to prevent
  truncation/integer overflow issues (bsc#1092100).


  Also this non-security issue was fixed:

  - Fix CPU summary showing old data. (bsc#1121753)

  The update to 3.3.15 contains the following fixes:

  * library: Increment to 8:0:1 No removals, no new functions Changes: slab
  and pid structures

  * library: Just check for SIGLOST and don't delete it

  * library: Fix integer overflow and LPE in file2strvec   CVE-2018-1124

  * library: Use size_t for alloc functions                CVE-2018-1126

  * library: Increase comm size to 64

  * pgrep: Fix stack-based buffer overflow                 CVE-2018-1125

  * pgrep: Remove >15 warning as comm can be longer

  * ps: Fix buffer overflow in output buffer, causing DOS  CVE-2018-1123

  * ps: Increase command name selection field to 64

  * top: Don't use cwd for location of config              CVE-2018-1122

  * update translations

  * library: build on non-glibc systems

  * free: fix scaling on 32-bit systems

  * Revert 'Support running with child namespaces'

  * library: Increment to 7:0:1 No changes, no removals New functions:
  numa_init, numa_max_node, numa_node_of_cpu, numa_uninit,
  xalloc_err_handler

  * doc: Document I idle state in ps.1 and top.1

  * free: fix some of the SI multiples

  * kill: -l space between name parses correctly

  * library: don't use vm_min_free on non Linux

  * library: don't st ...
