  nasm was updated to version 2.14.02.

  This allows building of Mozilla Firefox 78ESR and also contains lots of
  bugfixes, security fixes and improvements.

  * Fix crash due to multiple errors or warnings during the code generation
  pass if a list file is specified.

  * Create all system-defined macros before processing command-line given
  preprocessing directives (-p, -d, -u, --pragma, --before).

  * If debugging is enabled, define a __DEBUG_FORMAT__ predefined macro. See
  section 4.11.7.

  * Fix an assert for the case in the obj format when a SEG operator refers
  to an EXTERN symbol declared further down in the code.

  * Fix a corner case in the floating-point code where a binary, octal or
  hexadecimal floating-point having at least 32, 11, or 8 mantissa digits
  could produce slightly incorrect results under very specific conditions.

  * Support -MD without a filename, for gcc compatibility. -MF can be used
  to set the dependencies output filename. See section 2.1.7.

  * Fix -E in combination with -MD. See section 2.1.21.

  * Fix missing errors on redefined labels, would cause convergence failure
  instead which is very slow and not easy to debug.

  * Duplicate definitions of the same label with the same value is now
  explicitly permitted (2.14 would allow it in some circumstances.)

  * Add the option --no-line to ignore %line directives in the source. See
  section 2.1.33 and section 4.10.1.

  * Changed -I option semantics by adding a trailing path separator
  unconditionally.

  * Fixed null dereference in corrupted invalid single line macros.

  * Fixed division by zero which may happen if source code is malformed.

  * Fixed out of bound access in processing of malformed segment override.

  * Fixed out of bound access in certain EQU parsing.

  * Fixed buffer underflow in float parsing.

  * Added SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) instructions.

  * Added +n syntax for multiple contiguous registers.

  * Fixed subsections_via_symbols for macho object format.

  * Added the --gprefix, --gpostfix, --lprefix, and --lpostfix command line
  options, to allow command line base symbol renaming. See section 2.1.28.

  * Allow label renaming to be specified by %pragma in addition to from the
  command line. See section 6.9.

  * Supported generic %pragma namespaces, output and debug. See section 6.10.

  * Added the --pragma command line option to inject a %pragma directive.
  See section 2.1.29.

  * Added the --before command line option to accept preprocess statement
  before input. See section 2.1.30.

  * Added AVX512 VBMI2 (Additional ...
