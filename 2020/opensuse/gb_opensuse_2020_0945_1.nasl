  rust was updated for use by Firefox 76ESR.

  - Fixed miscompilations with rustc 1.43 that lead to LTO failures
  (bsc#1173202)

  Update to version 1.43.1

  - Updated openssl-src to 1.1.1g for CVE-2020-1967.

  - Fixed the stabilization of AVX-512 features.

  - Fixed `cargo package --list` not working with unpublished dependencies.

  Update to version 1.43.0

  + Language:

  - Fixed using binary operations with `&{number}` (e.g. `&1.0`) not having
  the type inferred correctly.

  - Attributes such as `#[cfg()]` can now be used on `if` expressions.

  - Syntax only changes:

  * Allow `type Foo: Ord` syntactically.

  * Fuse associated and extern items up to defaultness.

  * Syntactically allow `self` in all `fn` contexts.

  * Merge `fn` syntax + cleanup item parsing.

  * `item` macro fragments can be interpolated into `trait`s, `impl`s, and
  `extern` blocks. For example, you may now write: ```rust macro_rules!
  mac_trait { ($i:item) => { trait T { $i } } } mac_trait! { fn foo() {}
  } ```

  * These are still rejected *semantically*, so you will likely receive an
  error but these changes can be seen and parsed by macros and
  conditional compilation.

  + Compiler

  - You can now pass multiple lint flags to rustc to override the previous
  flags.

  For example, `rustc -D unused -A unused-variables` denies everything in
  the `unused` lint group except `unused-variables` which is explicitly
  allowed. However, passing `rustc -A unused-variables -D unused` denies
  everything in the `unused` lint group **including** `unused-variables`
  since the allow flag is specified before the deny flag (and therefore
  overridden).

  - rustc will now prefer your system MinGW libraries over its bundled
  libraries if they are available on `windows-gnu`.

  - rustc now buffers errors/warnings printed in JSON.

  Libraries:

  - `Arc<[T, N]>`, `Box<[T, N]>`, and `Rc<[T, N]>`, now implement
  `TryFrom<Arc<[T]>>`, `TryFrom<Box<[T]>>`, and `TryFrom<Rc<[T]>>`
  respectively.
  **Note** These conversions are only available when `N` is `0..=32`.

  - You can now use associated constants on floats and integers directly,
  rather than having to import the module. e.g. You can now write
  `u32::MAX` or `f32::NAN` with no imports.

  - `u8::is_ascii` is now `const`.

  - `String` now implements `AsMut<str>`.

  - Added the `primitive` module to `std` and `core`. This module reexports
  Rust's primitive types. This is mainly useful in macros where you want
  avoid these types being shadowed.

  - Relaxed some of the trait bounds on `HashMap` and `HashSe ...
