  - fossil 2.12.1:

  * CVE-2020-24614: Remote authenticated users with check-in or
  administrative privileges could have executed arbitrary code
  [boo#1175760]

  * Security fix in the 'fossil git export' command. New 'safety-net'
  features were added to prevent similar problems in the future.

  * Enhancements to the graph display for cases when there are many
  cherry-pick merges into a single check-in. Example

  * Enhance the fossil open command with the new --workdir option and the
  ability to accept a URL as the repository name, causing the remote
  repository to be cloned automatically. Do not allow 'fossil open' to
  open in a non-empty working directory unless the --keep option or the
  new --force option is used.

  * Enhance the markdown formatter to more closely follow the CommonMark
  specification with regard to text highlighting. Underscores in the
  middle of identifiers (ex: fossil_printf()) no longer need to be
  escaped.

  * The markdown-to-html translator can prevent unsafe HTML (for example:
  <script>) on user-contributed pages like forum and tickets and wiki.
  The admin can adjust this behavior using the safe-html setting on the
  Admin/Wiki page. The default is to disallow unsafe HTML everywhere.

  * Added the 'collapse' and 'expand' capability for long forum posts.

  * The 'fossil remote' command now has options for specifying multiple
  persistent remotes with symbolic names. Currently
  only one remote can be used at a time, but that might change in the
  future.

  * Add the 'Remember me?' checkbox on the login page. Use a session
  cookie for the login if it is not checked.

  * Added the experimental 'fossil hook' command for managing 'hook
  scripts' that run before checkin or after a push.

  * Enhance the fossil revert command so that it is able to revert all
  files beneath a directory.

  * Add the fossil bisect skip command.

  * Add the fossil backup command.

  * Enhance fossil bisect ui so that it shows all unchecked check-ins in
  between the innermost 'good' and 'bad' check-ins.

  * Added the --reset flag to the 'fossil add', 'fossil rm', and 'fossil
  addremove' commands.

  * Added the '--min N' and '--logfile FILENAME' flags to the backoffice
  command, as well as other enhancements to make the backoffice command
  a viable replacement for automatic backoffice. Other incremental
  backoffice improvements.

  * Added the /fileedit page, which allows editing of text files
  online. Requires explicit activation by a setup user.

  * Translate built-in help text into HTML for display o ...
