  following issues:

  podman was updated to 1.8.0:

  - CVE-2019-18466: Fixed a bug where podman cp would improperly copy files
  on the host when copying a symlink in the container that included a glob
  operator (#3829 bsc#1155217)

  - The name of the cni-bridge in the default config changed from 'cni0' to
  'podman-cni0' with podman-1.6.0. Add a %trigger to rename the bridge in
  the system to the new default if it exists. The trigger is only executed
  when updating podman-cni-config from something older than 1.6.0. This is
  mainly needed for SLE where we're updating from 1.4.4 to 1.8.0
  (bsc#1160460).

  Update podman to v1.8.0 (bsc#1160460):

  * Features

  - The podman system service command has been added, providing a preview
  of Podman's new Docker-compatible API. This API is still very new, and
  not yet ready for production use, but is available for early testing

  - Rootless Podman now uses Rootlesskit for port forwarding, which should
  greatly improve performance and capabilities

  - The podman untag command has been added to remove tags from images
  without deleting them

  - The podman inspect command on images now displays previous names they
  used

  - The podman generate systemd command now supports a --new
  option to generate service files that create and run new containers
  instead of managing existing containers

  - Support for --log-opt tag= to set logging tags has been added to the
  journald log driver

  - Added support for using Seccomp profiles embedded in images for podman
  run and podman create via the new --seccomp-policy CLI flag

  - The podman play kube command now honors pull policy

  * Bugfixes

  - Fixed a bug where the podman cp command would not copy the contents of
  directories when paths ending in /. were given

  - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command did not properly locate
  Seccomp profiles specified relative to localhost

  - Fixed a bug where the podman info command for remote Podman did not
  show registry information

  - Fixed a bug where the podman exec command did not support having input
  piped into it

  - Fixed a bug where the podman cp command with rootless Podman
  on CGroups v2 systems did not properly determine if the container
  could be paused while copying

  - Fixed a bug where the podman container prune --force command could
  possible remove running containers if they were started while the
  command was running

  - Fixed a bug where Podman, when run as root, would not properly
  configure slirp4netns networking when requested

  - Fixed a ...
