CVE-2005-1151

Jens Steube discovered that while processing local files owned or
provided by a normal user privileges weren't dropped, which could
lead to the overwriting or creation of arbitrary files as root.

CVE-2005-1152

The upstream developers noticed that qpopper could be tricked to
creating group- or world-writable files.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.4-2.woody.5.

For the testing distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.5-4sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed in
version 4.0.5-4sarge1.");
