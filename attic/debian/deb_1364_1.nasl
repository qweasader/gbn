Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-2953

Ulf Harnhammar discovered that a format string flaw in helptags_one() from
src/ex_cmds.c (triggered through the helptags command) can lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-2438

Editors often provide a way to embed editor configuration commands (aka
modelines) which are executed once a file is opened. Harmful commands
are filtered by a sandbox mechanism. It was discovered that function
calls to writefile(), feedkeys() and system() were not filtered, allowing
shell command execution with a carefully crafted file opened in vim.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 6.3-071+1sarge2. Sarge is not affected by CVE-2007-2438.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 7.0-122+1etch3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.1-056+1.");
