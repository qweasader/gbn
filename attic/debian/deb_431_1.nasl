program to run perl scripts with setuid privileges.  By exploiting
these bugs, an attacker could abuse suidperl to discover information
about files (such as testing for their existence and some of their
permissions) that should not be accessible to unprivileged users.

For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 5.6.1-8.6.

For the unstable distribution, this problem will be fixed soon.  Refer
to Debian bug #220486.

We recommend that you update your perl package if you have the
perl-suid package installed.");
