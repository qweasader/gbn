incorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox. In some configurations,
this allows for appending data to arbitrary files as root.

The default Debian installation of Postfix is not affected. Only a
configuration meeting the following requirements is vulnerable:

  * The mail delivery style is mailbox, with the Postfix built-in
local(8) or virtual(8) delivery agents.

  * The mail spool directory is user-writeable.

  * The user can create hardlinks pointing to root-owned symlinks
located in other directories.

For a detailed treating of this issue, please see the referenced upstream
author's announcement.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.8-2etch1.

For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.2-2lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.5.4-1.");
