The original text is reproduced below:

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in samba,
a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5398

Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that nmbd did not properly
check the length of netbios packets. When samba is configured as a WINS
server, a remote attacker could send multiple crafted requests resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

CVE-2007-4572
Samba developers discovered that nmbd could be made to overrun a buffer
during the processing of GETDC logon server requests.  When samba is
configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller, a remote attacker
could send malicious logon requests and possibly cause a denial of
service.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.24-6etch7.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.14a-3sarge9.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.27-1.");
