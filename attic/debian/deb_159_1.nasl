This problem has been fixed in several versions of Python: For the
current stable distribution (woody) it has been fixed in version
1.5.2-23.1 of Python 1.5, in version 2.1.3-3.1 of Python 2.1 and in
version 2.2.1-4.1 of Python 2.2.  For the old stable distribution
(potato) this has been fixed in version 1.5.2-10potato12 for Python
1.5.  For the unstable distribution (sid) this has been fixed in
version 1.5.2-24 of Python 1.5, in version 2.1.3-6a of Python 2.1 and
in version 2.2.1-8 of Python 2.2.  Python 2.3 is not affected by this
