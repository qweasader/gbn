For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in

For reference the advisory text follows:

A vulnerability has been discovered in the Cyrus implementation of
the SASL library, the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a
method for adding authentication support to connection-based
protocols.  The library honors the environment variable SASL_PATH
blindly, which allows a local user to link against a malicious
library to run arbitrary code with the privileges of a setuid or
setgid application.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.28-6.2 of cyrus-sasl and in version 2.1.19-1.3 of
cyrus-sasl2.");
