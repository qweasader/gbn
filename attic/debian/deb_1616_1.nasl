toolkit's parsing of Petite-packed Win32 executables.  The weakness
leads to an invalid memory access, and could enable an attacker to
crash clamav by supplying a maliciously crafted Petite-compressed
binary for scanning.  In some configurations, such as when clamav
is used in combination with mail servers, this could cause a system
to fail open, facilitating a follow-on viral attack.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
weakness as CVE-2008-2713.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.90.1dfsg-3etch13.  For the unstable distribution (sid), the
problem has been fixed in version 0.93.1.dfsg-1.1.");
