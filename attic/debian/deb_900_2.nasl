Due to restrictive dependency definition the updated fetchmailconf package couldn't be installed on the old stable distribution (woody) together with fetchmail-ssl.  Hence, this update loosens it, so that the update can be pulled in.  For completeness we're including the original advisory text:  Thomas Wolff discovered that the fetchmailconfig program which is provided as part of fetchmail, an SSL enabled POP3, APOP, IMAP mail gatherer/forwarder, creates the new configuration in an insecure fashion that can lead to leaking passwords for mail accounts to local users.  This update also fixes a regression in the package for stable caused by the last security update.  For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in version 5.9.11-6.4.

This VT has been merged into the VT 'Debian: Security Advisory (DSA-900)' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.55908).");
