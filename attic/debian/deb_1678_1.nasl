It was possible to exploit a race condition to create setuid binaries in a directory tree or remove arbitrary files when a process is deleting this tree. This issue was originally known as CVE-2005-0448 and CVE-2004-0452, which were addressed by DSA-696-1 and DSA-620-1. Unfortunately, they were reintroduced later.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version 5.8.8-7etch5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 5.10.0-18 and will migrate to the testing distribution (lenny) shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.");
