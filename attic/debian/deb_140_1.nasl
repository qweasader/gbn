progressive reader when the PNG datastream contains more IDAT data
than indicated by the IHDR chunk.  Such deliberately malformed
datastreams would crash applications which could potentially allow an
attacker to execute malicious code.  Programs such as Galeon,
Konquerer and various others make use of these libraries.

To find out which packages depend on this library, you may want to
execute the following commands:

apt-cache showpkg libpng2
apt-cache showpkg libpng3

This problem has been fixed in version 1.0.12-3.woody.1 of libpng and
version 1.2.1-1.1.woody.1 of libpng3 for the current stable
distribution (woody) and in version 1.0.12-4 of libpng and version
