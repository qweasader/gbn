CVE-2011-0696

For several reasons the internal CSRF protection was not used to validate AJAX requests in the past. However, it was discovered that this exception can be exploited with a combination of browser plugins and redirects and thus is not sufficient.

CVE-2011-0697

It was discovered that the file upload form is prone to cross-site scripting attacks via the file name.
