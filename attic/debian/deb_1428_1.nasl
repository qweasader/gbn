kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2007-3104

Eric Sandeen provided a backport of Tejun Heo's fix for a local denial
of service vulnerability in sysfs. Under memory pressure, a dentry
structure maybe reclaimed resulting in a bad pointer dereference causing
an oops during a readdir.

CVE-2007-4997

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that make use of the
Linux kernel's ieee80211 layer. A remote user could generate a malicious
802.11 frame that could result in a denial of service (crash). The ipw2100
driver is known to be affected by this issue, while the ipw2200 is
believed not to be.

CVE-2007-5500

Scott James Remnant diagnosed a coding error in the implementation of
ptrace which could be used by a local user to cause the kernel to enter
an infinite loop.

These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version
2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch5.

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

Debian 4.0 (etch)
