segmentation faults in gethostbyaddr with non-localhost input.  This
update also disables IPv6 on all architectures.

The original advisory said:

Sebastian Schmidt discovered a buffer overflow bug in Python's
getaddrinfo function, which could allow an IPv6 address, supplied by a
remote attacker via DNS, to overwrite memory on the stack.

This bug only exists in python 2.2 and 2.2.1, and only when IPv6
support is disabled.  The python2.2 package in Debian woody meets
these conditions (the 'python' package does not).

For the stable distribution (woody), this bug has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-4.5.

The testing and unstable distribution (sid) are not affected by this problem.

We recommend that you update your python2.2 package.");
