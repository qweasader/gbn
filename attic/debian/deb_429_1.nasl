ElGamal keys for signing.  This is a significant security failure

signing.

This update disables the use of this type of key.

For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.0.6-4woody1.

For the unstable distribution, this problem has been fixed in version
1.2.4-1.
