CVE-2009-0581

Chris Evans discovered that lcms is affected by a memory leak, which could result in a denial of service via specially crafted image files.

CVE-2009-0723

Chris Evans discovered that lcms is prone to several integer overflows via specially crafted image files, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-0733

Chris Evans discovered the lack of upper-bounds check on sizes leading to a buffer overflow, which could be used to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 1.17.dfsg-1+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version 1.15-1.1+etch2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your lcms packages.");
