CVE-2007-6697

Gynvael Coldwind discovered a buffer overflow in GIF image parsing,
which could result in denial of service and potentially the
execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-0544

It was discovered that a buffer overflow in IFF ILBM image parsing
could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5-2etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.4-1etch1. Due to a copy & paste error etch1 was appended
to the version number instead of sarge1. Since the update is otherwise
technically correct, the update was not rebuild to the buildd network.");
