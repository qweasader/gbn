CVE-2015-6823

The allocate_buffers function in libavcodec/alac.c did not initialize certain context data, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) data. This issues has now been addressed by clearing pointers in avcodec/alac.c's allocate_buffers().

Other than stated in debian/changelog of upload 6:11.12-1~deb8u2, this issue only now got fixed with upload of 6:11.12-1~deb8u3.

CVE-2015-6824

The sws_init_context function in libswscale/utils.c did not initialize certain pixbuf data structures, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted video data. In swscale/utils.c now these pix buffers get cleared which fixes use of uninitialized memory.

Other than stated in debian/changelog of upload 6:11.12-1~deb8u2, this issue only now got fixed with upload of 6:11.12-1~deb8u3.

For Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version 6:11.12-1~deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libav packages.
