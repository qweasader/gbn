This update addresses this issue by reimplementing the relevant Perl operators without relying on the Perl interpreter, trying to preserve backwards compatibility as much as possible.

For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version 2.9.26etch4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version 2.10.35lenny6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed in version 2.10.54.
