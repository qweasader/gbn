  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:

CVE-2011-1938

The UNIX socket handling allowed attackers to trigger a buffer overflow
via a long path name.

CVE-2011-2483

The crypt_blowfish function did not properly handle 8-bit characters,
which made it easier for attackers to determine a cleartext password
by using knowledge of a password hash.

CVE-2011-4566

When used on 32 bit platforms, the exif extension could be used to
trigger an integer overflow in the exif_process_IFD_TAG function
when processing a JPEG file.

CVE-2011-4885

It was possible to trigger hash collisions predictably when parsing
form parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service by sending many crafted parameters.

CVE-2012-0057

When applying a crafted XSLT transform, an attacker could write files
to arbitrary places in the filesystem.

NOTE: the fix for CVE-2011-2483 required changing the behaviour of this
function: it is now incompatible with some old (wrongly) generated hashes
for passwords containing 8-bit characters. See the package NEWS entry
for details. This change has not been applied to the Lenny version of PHP.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny14.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.3.3-7+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 5.3.9-1.");
