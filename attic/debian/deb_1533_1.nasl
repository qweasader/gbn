number of vulnerabilities in exiftags, a utility for extracting EXIF
metadata from JPEG images. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identified the following three problems:

CVE-2007-6354

Inadequate EXIF property validation could lead to invalid memory
accesses if executed on a maliciously crafted image, potentially
including heap corruption and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-6355

Flawed data validation could lead to integer overflows, causing
other invalid memory accesses, also with the potential for memory
corruption or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2007-6356

Cyclical EXIF image file directory (IFD) references could cause
a denial of service (infinite loop).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.98-1.1+etch1.

The old stable distribution (sarge) cannot be fixed synchronously
with the Etch version due to a technical limitation in the Debian
archive management scripts.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.01-0.1.");
