Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and derived products such as Mozilla Thunderbird. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-2779

Mozilla team members discovered several crashes during testing of the browser engine showing evidence of memory corruption which may also lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The last bit of this problem will be corrected with the next update. You can prevent any trouble by disabling Javascript. [MFSA-2006-32]

CVE-2006-3805

The Javascript engine might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. [MFSA-2006-50]

CVE-2006-3806

Multiple integer overflows in the Javascript engine might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. [MFSA-2006-50]

CVE-2006-3807

Specially crafted Javascript allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. [MFSA-2006-51]

CVE-2006-3808

Remote Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) servers could execute code with elevated privileges via a specially crafted PAC script. [MFSA-2006-52]

CVE-2006-3809

Scripts with the UniversalBrowserRead privilege could gain UniversalXPConnect privileges and possibly execute code or obtain sensitive data. [MFSA-2006-53]

CVE-2006-3810

A cross-site scripting vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. [MFSA-2006-54]

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in version 1.0.2-2.sarge1.0.8b.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version 1.5.0.5-1.
