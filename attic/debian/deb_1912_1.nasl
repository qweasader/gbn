This advisory addresses issues with the reading of TIFF files. It also expands the patch for CVE-2009-2660 to cover another potential overflow in the processing of JPEG images.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version 2.20-8+etch3.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version 1:2.2.0-4+lenny3.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your camlimages package.");
