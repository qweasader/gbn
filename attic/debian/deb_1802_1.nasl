a webmail application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1578

Cross site scripting was possible through a number of pages which
allowed an attacker to steal sensitive session data.

CVE-2009-1579

Code injection was possible when SquirrelMail was configured to
use the map_yp_alias function to authenticate users. This is not
the default.

CVE-2009-1580

It was possible to hijack an active user session by planting a
specially crafted cookie into the user's browser.

CVE-2009-1581

Specially crafted HTML emails could use the CSS positioning feature
to place email content over the SquirrelMail user interface, allowing
for phishing.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.9a-4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-1.");
