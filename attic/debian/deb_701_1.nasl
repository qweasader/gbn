Samba, a LanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and
Unix-like systems.  Requesting a very large number of access control
descriptors from the server could exploit the integer overflow, which
may result in a buffer overflow which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with root privileges.  Upstream developers have
discovered more possible integer overflows that are fixed with this
update as well.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3a-14.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.10-1.");
