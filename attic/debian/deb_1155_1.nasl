You'll have to download the referenced file for your architecture from below and install it with dpkg -i.

As an alternative, temporarily adding the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list will mitigate the problem as well:

deb [link moved to references] stable-proposed-updates main

Here is the original security advisory for completeness:

Frank Sheiness discovered that a MIME conversion routine in sendmail, a powerful, efficient, and scalable mail transport agent, could be tricked by a specially crafted mail to perform an endless recursion.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in version 8.13.4-3sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in version 8.13.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sendmail package.");
