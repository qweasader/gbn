Two security related problems have been discovered in mailman,
web-based GNU mailing list manager.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2004-1177

Florian Weimer discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
mailman's automatically generated error messages.  An attacker
could craft an URL containing JavaScript (or other content
embedded into HTML) which triggered a mailman error page that
would include the malicious code verbatim.

CVE-2005-0202

Several listmasters have noticed unauthorised access to archives
of private lists and the list configuration itself, including the
users passwords.  Administrators are advised to check the
webserver logfiles for requests that contain /...../ and the
path to the archives or configuration.  This does only seem to
affect installations running on web servers that do not strip
slashes, such as Apache 1.3.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1woody10.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.5-6.");
