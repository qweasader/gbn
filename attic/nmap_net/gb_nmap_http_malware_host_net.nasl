Currently, the only signature it looks for is the one discussed in the referenced link. This is
done by requesting the page '/ts/in.cgi?open2' and looking for an errant 302 (it attempts
to detect servers that always return 302). Thanks to Denis from the above link for finding this
technique!

SYNTAX:

http.pipeline:  If set, it represents the number of HTTP requests that'll be
pipelined (ie, sent in a single request). This can be set low to make
debugging easier, or it can be set high to test how a server reacts (its
chosen max is ignored).

http-max-cache-size:  The maximum memory size (in bytes) of the cache.");
