VxWorks Wind DeBug agents.

Wind DeBug is a SunRPC-type service that is enabled by default on many devices that use the popular
VxWorks real-time embedded operating system. H.D. Moore of Metasploit has identified several
security vulnerabilities and design flaws with the service, including weakly-hashed passwords and
raw memory dumping.

SYNTAX:

nfs.version:  number If set overrides the detected version of nfs

mount.version:  number If set overrides the detected version of mountd

rpc.protocol:  table If set overrides the preferred order in which
protocols are tested. (ie. 'tcp', 'udp')");
