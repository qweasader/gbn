  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The udev package contains an implementation of devfs in
userspace using sysfs and netlink.

Update Information:

udev provides a user-space API and implements a dynamic device directory,
providing only the devices present on the system. udev replaces devfs in order
to provide greater hot plug functionality. Netlink is a datagram oriented
service, used to transfer information between kernel modules and user-space
processes.

It was discovered that udev did not properly check the origin of
Netlink messages. A local attacker could use this flaw to gain root privileges
via a crafted Netlink message sent to udev, causing it to create a world-
writable block device file for an existing system block device (for example, the
root file system). (CVE-2009-1185)

An integer overflow flaw, potentially
leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in one of the utilities
providing functionality of the udev device information interface. An attacker
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service, or possibly, to execute
arbitrary code by providing a specially-crafted arguments as input to this
utility. (CVE-2009-1186)

Thanks to Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for responsibly
reporting this flaw.

Users of udev are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
update, the udevd daemon will be restarted automatically.
