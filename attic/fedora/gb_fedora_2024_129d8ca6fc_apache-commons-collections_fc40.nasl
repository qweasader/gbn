data structures has accelerated development by reducing the need for
custom container classes around each core object. Most Java2 APIs are
significantly easier to use because of the Collections API.
However, there are certain holes left unfilled by Sun&#39, s
implementations, and the Jakarta-Commons Collections Component strives
to fulfill them. Among the features of this package are:

  - special-purpose implementations of Lists and Maps for fast access

  - adapter classes from Java1-style containers (arrays, enumerations) to
Java2-style collections.

  - methods to test or create typical set-theory properties of collections
such as union, intersection, and closure.");
