KeePassXC is an application for people with extremely high demands on secure
personal data management.
KeePassXC saves many different information e.g. user names, passwords, urls,
attachemts and comments in one single database. For a better management
user-defined titles and icons can be specified for each single entry.
Furthermore the entries are sorted in groups, which are customizable as well.
The integrated search function allows to search in a single group or the
complete database.
KeePassXC offers a little utility for secure password generation. The password
generator is very customizable, fast and easy to use. Especially someone who
generates passwords frequently will appreciate this feature.
The complete database is always encrypted either with AES (alias Rijndael) or
Twofish encryption algorithm using a 256 bit key. Therefore the saved
information can be considered as quite safe.");
