Update Information:

This update contains the latest stable release of Apache httpd. Three security
fixes are included, along with several minor bug fixes.    A flaw was found in
the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw
to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's session (for example, an HTTPS
connection to a website). This could force the server to process an attacker's
request as if authenticated using the victim's credentials. This update
partially mitigates this flaw for SSL sessions to HTTP servers using mod_ssl by
rejecting client-requested renegotiation. (CVE-2009-3555)    Note: This update
does not fully resolve the issue for HTTPS servers. An attack is still possible
in configurations that require a server-initiated renegotiation

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp module. A
malicious FTP server to which requests are being proxied could use this flaw to
crash an httpd child process via a malformed reply to the EPSV or PASV commands,
resulting in a limited denial of service. (CVE-2009-3094)

A second flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp module. In a reverse
proxy configuration, a remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass
intended access restrictions by creating a carefully-crafted HTTP
Authorization header, allowing the attacker to send arbitrary commands
to the FTP server. (CVE-2009-3095)
