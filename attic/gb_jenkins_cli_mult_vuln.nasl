  - The salt used to generate the CSRF protection tokens is a publicly accessible
    value.

  - When creating a job using the create-job CLI command, external entities are
    not discarded (nor processed).

  - JNLP slave connections did not verify that the correct secret was supplied.

  - The /queue/api URL could return information about items not accessible to
    the current user.

  - The CLI command overview and help pages in Jenkins were accessible without
    Overall/Read permission.

  - Access to the /jnlpJars/ URL was not limited to the specific JAR files users
    needed to access, allowing browsing directories and downloading other files in
    the Jenkins servlet resources.

  - API tokens of other users were exposed to admins by default.

  - Slaves connecting via JNLP were not subject to the optional slave-to-master
    access control.

  - Users with the permission to take slave nodes offline can enter arbitrary
    HTML.

  - An error due to unsafe deserialization.");
