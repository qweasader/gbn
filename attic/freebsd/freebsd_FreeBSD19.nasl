CVE-2011-4576
The SSL 3.0 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before
1.0.0f does not properly initialize data structures for block cipher
padding, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by decrypting the padding data sent by an SSL peer.
CVE-2011-4619
The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL before
0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f does not properly handle handshake
restarts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2011-4109
Double free vulnerability in OpenSSL 0.9.8 before 0.9.8s, when
X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is enabled, allows remote attackers to have
an unspecified impact by triggering failure of a policy check.
CVE-2012-0884
The implementation of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and PKCS #7
in OpenSSL before 0.9.8u and 1.x before 1.0.0h does not properly
restrict certain oracle behavior, which makes it easier for
context-dependent attackers to decrypt data via a Million Message
Attack (MMA) adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.
CVE-2012-2110
The asn1_d2i_read_bio function in crypto/asn1/a_d2i_fp.c in OpenSSL
before 0.9.8v, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0i, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1a does not
properly interpret integer data, which allows remote attackers to
conduct buffer overflow attacks, and cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact, via crafted DER
data, as demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an RSA public key.");
