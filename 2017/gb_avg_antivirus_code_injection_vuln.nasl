  script_tag(name:"vuldetect", value:"Checks if a vulnerable version is present on the target host.");

  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The flaw exists due to:

  - No use of Protected Processes feature, and therefore an attacker can enter an
    arbitrary Application Verifier Provider DLL under Image File Execution Options
    in the registry.

  - The self-protection mechanism is intended to block all local processes
    (regardless of privileges) from modifying Image File Execution Options for these
    products.");

  vulnerabilities will allow a local attacker to bypass a self-protection
  mechanism, inject arbitrary code, and take full control of any AVG process
  via a 'DoubleAgent' attack.");
