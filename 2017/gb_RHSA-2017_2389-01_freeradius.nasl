  Security Fix(es): * An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS
  server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server or to execute arbitrary code in the
  context of the FreeRADIUS server process by sending a specially crafted request
  packet. (CVE-2017-10984) * An out-of-bounds read and write flaw was found in the
  way FreeRADIUS server handled RADIUS packets. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted RADIUS
  packet. (CVE-2017-10978) * An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way
  FreeRADIUS server handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP
  request. (CVE-2017-10983) * A denial of service flaw was found in the way
  FreeRADIUS server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to cause the FreeRADIUS server to enter an infinite
  loop, consume increasing amounts of memory resources, and ultimately crash by
  sending a specially crafted request packet. (CVE-2017-10985) * Multiple
  out-of-bounds read flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled
  decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash the
  FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP request. (CVE-2017-10986,
  CVE-2017-10987) Red Hat would like to thank the FreeRADIUS project for reporting
  these issues. Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of
  these issues.");
