There were additional vulnerabilities in the tools bmp2tiff, gif2tiff, thumbnail and ras2tiff, but since these were addressed by the libtiff developers by removing the tools altogether, no patches are available and those tools were also removed from the tiff package in Debian stable. The change had already been made in Debian stretch before and no applications included in Debian are known to rely on these scripts. If you use those tools in custom setups, consider using a different conversion/thumbnailing tool.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in version 4.0.3-12.3+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 4.0.7-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.0.7-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.");
