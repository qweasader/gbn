  - OpenSSL Security Advisory [07 Dec 2017]

  * CVE-2017-3737: OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced
  an \'error state\' mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error
  occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error
  state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the
  handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions
  (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a
  bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called
  directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error
  will be returned in the initial function call. If
  SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for
  the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed
  without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record
  layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to
  be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being
  issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version
  1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is
  not affected. (bsc#1071905)

  * CVE-2017-3738: There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery
  multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli.
  No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against
  RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to
  perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are
  considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce
  information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount
  of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
  However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have
  to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no
  longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors
  that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th
  generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to
  CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. (bsc#1071906)
