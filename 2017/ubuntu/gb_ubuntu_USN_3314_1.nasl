some situations did not prevent special internal keyrings from being joined
by userspace keyrings. A privileged local attacker could use this to bypass
module verification. (CVE-2016-9604)

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the trace subsystem in
the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could use this to execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0605)

Daniel Jiang discovered that a race condition existed in the ipv4 ping
socket implementation in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-2671)

JongHwan Kim discovered an out-of-bounds read in the TCP stack of the Linux
kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or leak sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7277)

Eric Biggers discovered a memory leak in the keyring implementation in the
Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory consumption). (CVE-2017-7472)

Sabrina Dubroca discovered that the asynchronous cryptographic hash (ahash)
implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle a full request
queue. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(infinite recursion). (CVE-2017-7618)

Tuomas Haanpaa and Ari Kauppi discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server
implementations in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain long
RPC replies. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2017-7645)

Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler discovered that the memory manager in the
Linux kernel did not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection
mechanism. A local attacker with access to /dev/mem could use this to
expose sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2017-7889)

Tuomas Haanpaa and Ari Kauppi discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server
implementations in the Linux kernel did not properly check for the end of
buffer. A remote attacker could use this to craft requests that cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2017-7895)

Fabian Grunbichler discovered that the Packet action API implementation in
the Linux kernel improperly handled uninitialized data. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7979)

It was discovered that the Conexant USB driver in the Linux kernel
improperly handled memory in some configurations. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-8063)

It was discovered that the DVD USB framework in the Linux kernel improperly
handled memory in some configurations. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-8064)
