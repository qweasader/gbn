performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this
issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This
issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as other
releases were fixed in a previous security update. (CVE-2016-2177)

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle Montgomery
multiplication, resulting in incorrect results leading to transient
failures. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10.
(CVE-2016-7055)

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly use constant-time
operations when performing ECDSA P-256 signing. A remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to perform a timing attack and recover private
ECDSA keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04
LTS. (CVE-2016-7056)

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain warning alerts.
A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to stop
responding, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-8610)

Robert Swiecki discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain
truncated packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause
OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-3731)

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86_64 Montgomery
squaring procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could possibly use
this issue to recover private keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04
LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2017-3732)");
