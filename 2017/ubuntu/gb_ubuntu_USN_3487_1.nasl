  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was discovered that the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly keep track of nested levels in guest page tables. A local attacker
in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host OS. (CVE-2017-12188)

It was discovered that on the PowerPC architecture, the kernel did not
properly sanitize the signal stack when handling sigreturn(). A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-1000255)

Bo Zhang discovered that the netlink wireless configuration interface in
the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes when handling certain
requests. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12153)

It was discovered that the nested KVM implementation in the Linux kernel in
some situations did not properly prevent second level guests from reading
and writing the hardware CR8 register. A local attacker in a guest could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12154)

Vitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the SCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly track reference counts when merging buffers. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2017-12190)

It was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly restrict key reads on negatively instantiated keys. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2017-12192)

It was discovered that the ATI Radeon framebuffer driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize a data structure returned to user space.
A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel
memory). (CVE-2017-14156)

ChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14489)

Alexander Potapenko discovered an information leak in the waitid
implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-14954)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ALSA subsystem of
the Linux kernel when creating and deleting a port via ioctl(). A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15265)

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Floating Point Unit (fpu) subsystem in
the Linux kernel did not properly handle attempts to set reserved bits in a
task's extended state (xstate) area. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-15537)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the packet fanout
implementation in the Linux kernel. A local ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
