  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an 'error state'
mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a
handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would
immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works
as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(),
SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work
correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that
scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in
the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently
called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed
and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from
the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application
bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to
SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a
fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected. (CVE-2017-3737)

There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure
used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are
affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result
of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed
likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because
most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may
be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an
attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be
meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among
multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This
only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions
like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is
similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL
version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL
1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new
release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in
OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in
commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository. (CVE-2017-3738)");
