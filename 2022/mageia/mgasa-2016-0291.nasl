  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, the decryption of the username/password is
vulnerable to a padding oracle attack. The can allow an attacker who has
access to a user's browser cookie file to decrypt the username and
password. Also, the same initialization vector (IV) is used to hash the
username and password stored in the phpMyAdmin cookie. If a user has the
same password as their username, an attacker who examines the browser
cookie can see that they are the same (CVE-2016-6606).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, multiple vulnerabilities have been
discovered in the following areas of phpMyAdmin: Zoom search, GIS editor,
Relation view, several Transformations, XML export, MediaWiki export,
Designer, when the MySQL server is running with a specially-crafted
log_bin directive, Database tab, Replication feature, and Database search
(CVE-2016-6607).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a vulnerability was found where a specially
crafted database name could be used to run arbitrary PHP commands through
the array export feature (CVE-2016-6609).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a full path disclosure vulnerability was
discovered where a user can trigger a particular error in the export
mechanism to discover the full path of phpMyAdmin on the disk
(CVE-2016-6610).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a vulnerability was reported where a
specially crafted database and/or table name can be used to trigger an SQL
injection attack through the export functionality (CVE-2016-6611).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a vulnerability was discovered where a user
can exploit the LOAD LOCAL INFILE functionality to expose files on the
server to the database system (CVE-2016-6612).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a vulnerability was found where a user can
specially craft a symlink on disk, to a file which phpMyAdmin is permitted
to read but the user is not, which phpMyAdmin will then expose to the user
(CVE-2016-6613).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a vulnerability was reported with the %u
username replacement functionality of the SaveDir and UploadDir features.
When the username substitution is configured, a specially-crafted user
name can be used to circumvent restrictions to traverse the file system
(CVE-2016-6614).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, multiple XSS vulnerabilities were found in
the following areas: Navigation pane and database/table hiding feature,
the 'Tracking' feature, and GIS visualization feature (CVE-2016-6615).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a vulnerability was discovered in the
following features where a user can execute an SQL injection attack
against the account of the control user: User group Designer
(CVE-2016-6616).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a vulnerability was found in the
transformation feature allowing a user to trigger a denial-of-service
(DOS) attack against the server (CVE-2016-6618).

In phpMyAdmin before 4.4.15.8, a vulnerability was discovered in the user
interface ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
