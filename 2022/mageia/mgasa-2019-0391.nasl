* A carefully constructed commit object with a very large number
 of parents may lead to potential out-of-bounds writes or
 potential denial of service.

* CVE-2019-1348: the fast-import stream command 'feature
 export-marks=path' allows writing to arbitrary file paths. As
 libgit2 does not offer any interface for fast-import, it is not
 susceptible to this vulnerability.

* CVE-2019-1350: recursive clones may lead to arbitrary remote
 code executing due to improper quoting of command line
 arguments. As libgit2 uses libssh2, which does not require us
 to perform command line parsing, it is not susceptible to this
 vulnerability.

* CVE-2019-1387: it is possible to let a submodule's git
 directory point into a sibling's submodule directory, which may
 result in overwriting parts of the Git repository and thus lead
 to arbitrary command execution. As libgit2 doesn't provide any
 way to do submodule clones natively, it is not susceptible to
 this vulnerability. Users of libgit2 that have implemented
 recursive submodule clones manually are encouraged to review
 their implementation for this vulnerability.");
