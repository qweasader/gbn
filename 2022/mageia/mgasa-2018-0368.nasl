In The Sleuth Kit (TSK) 4.4.2, opening a crafted ISO 9660 image triggers
an out-of-bounds read in iso9660_proc_dir() in tsk/fs/iso9660_dent.c in
libtskfs.a, as demonstrated by fls (CVE-2017-13755).

In The Sleuth Kit (TSK) 4.4.2, opening a crafted disk image triggers
infinite recursion in dos_load_ext_table() in tsk/vs/dos.c in libtskvs.a,
as demonstrated by mmls (CVE-2017-13756).

In The Sleuth Kit (TSK) 4.4.2, fls hangs on a corrupt exfat image in
tsk_img_read() in tsk/img/img_io.c in libtskimg.a (CVE-2017-13760).

An issue was discovered in libtskfs.a in The Sleuth Kit (TSK) from release
4.0.2 through to 4.6.1. An out-of-bounds read of a memory region was found
in the function ntfs_fix_idxrec in tsk/fs/ntfs_dent.cpp which could be
leveraged by an attacker to disclose information or manipulated to read
from unmapped memory causing a denial of service (CVE-2018-11737).

An issue was discovered in libtskfs.a in The Sleuth Kit (TSK) from release
4.0.2 through to 4.6.1. An out-of-bounds read of a memory region was found
in the function ntfs_make_data_run in tsk/fs/ntfs.c which could be
leveraged by an attacker to disclose information or manipulated to read
from unmapped memory causing a denial of service attack (CVE-2018-11738).

An issue was discovered in libtskimg.a in The Sleuth Kit (TSK) from release
4.0.2 through to 4.6.1. An out-of-bounds read of a memory region was found
in the function raw_read in tsk/img/raw.c which could be leveraged by an
attacker to disclose information or manipulated to read from unmapped
memory causing a denial of service attack (CVE-2018-11739).

An issue was discovered in libtskbase.a in The Sleuth Kit (TSK) from
release 4.0.2 through to 4.6.1. An out-of-bounds read of a memory region
was found in the function tsk_UTF16toUTF8 in tsk/base/tsk_unicode.c which
could be leveraged by an attacker to disclose information or manipulated
to read from unmapped memory causing a denial of service attack
(CVE-2018-11740).");
