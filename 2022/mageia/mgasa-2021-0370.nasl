  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on
CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of
service only by manipulating the processed input stream (CVE-2021-21341).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the processed
stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the
formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on
these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream
and replace or inject objects, that result in a server-side forgery request
(CVE-2021-21342).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the processed
stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly
written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type
information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace
or inject objects, that result in the deletion of a file on the local host
(CVE-2021-21343).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by
manipulating the processed input stream (CVE-2021-21344).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker who has sufficient rights to execute commands of the host only
by manipulating the processed input stream (CVE-2021-21345).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by
manipulating the processed input stream (CVE-2021-21346).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by
manipulating the processed input stream (CVE-2021-21347).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker to occupy a thread that consumes maximum CPU time and will
never return (CVE-2021-21348).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly
available only by manipulating the processed input stream (CVE-2021-21349).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code only by manipulating the processed
input stream (CVE-2021-21350).

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by
manipulating the processed input stream (CVE-2021-21351).

A vulnerability in XStream versions prior to 1.4.17 may allow a remote attacker
has sufficient rights to execute commands of the host only ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
