An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image
rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.3. A specially crafted XCF
image can cause a heap overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker
can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
(CVE-2018-3977)

An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX
file in SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer
overflow, resulting in too little memory being allocated, which can lead
to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. (CVE-2019-5052)

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image
rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XCF image
can cause a heap overflow, resulting in code execution. (CVE-2019-5058)

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image
rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image
can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This
buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow,
ultimately ending in code execution. (CVE-2019-5059)

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image
rendering function of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can
cause an integer overflow in the colorhash function, allocating too small
of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds, resulting in a
heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. (CVE-2019-5060)

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) through 1.2.15 and 2.x through 2.0.9 has a
heap-based buffer over-read in Blit1to4 in video/SDL_blit_1.c
(CVE-2019-7635).

An issue was discovered in libSDL2.a in Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
2.0.9 when used in conjunction with libSDL2_image.a in SDL2_image 2.0.4.
There is a NULL pointer dereference in the SDL stdio_read function in
file/SDL_rwops.c. (CVE-2019-12217)

An issue was discovered in libSDL2.a in Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
2.0.9 when used in conjunction with libSDL2_image.a in SDL2_image 2.0.4.
There is a NULL pointer dereference in the SDL2_image function
IMG_LoadPCX_RW at IMG_pcx.c. (CVE-2019-12218)

An issue was discovered in libSDL2.a in Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
2.0.9 when used in conjunction with libSDL2_image.a in SDL2_image 2.0.4.
There is an invalid free error in the SDL function SDL_SetError_REAL
at SDL_error.c. (CVE-2019-12219)

An issue was discovered in libSDL2.a in Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
2.0.9 when used in conjunction with libSDL2_image.a in SDL2_image 2.0.4.
There is an out-of-bounds read in the SDL function SDL_FreePalette_REAL
at video/SDL_pixels.c. (CVE-2019-12220)

An issue was discovered in libSDL2.a in Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
2.0.9 when used in conjunction with libSDL2_image.a in SDL2_image 2.0.4.
