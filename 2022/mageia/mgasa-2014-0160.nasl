In Moodle before 2.4.9, question strings were not being filtered correctly
possibly allowing cross site scripting, as quiz_question_tostring can cause
invalid HTML (CVE-2014-2571).

Feedback Availability dates not honored in complete.php in Moodle before
2.4.9, therefore it was possible to start a Feedback activity while it was
supposed to be closed (CVE-2014-0127).

Broken access control vulnerability in Moodle before 2.4.9 with
/mod/chat/chat_ajax.php, where capabilities to chat were being checked at the
start of a chat, but not during, so changes were not effective immediately
(CVE-2014-0122).

In Moodle before 2.4.9, there were missing access checks on Wiki pages
allowing students to see pages of other students' individual wikis, through
the Recent activity block (CVE-2014-0123).

In Moodle before 2.4.9, cross site scripting was possible with Flowplayer
(CVE-2013-7341).

In Moodle before 2.4.9, Forum and Quiz were showing users' email addresses
when settings were supposed to be preventing this (CVE-2014-0124).

In Moodle before 2.4.9, alias links to items in an Alfresco repository were
provided with information that would allow someone to impersonate the file
owner in Alfresco (CVE-2014-0125).

Cross Site Request Forgery in Moodle before 2.4.9 in
enrol/imsenterprise/importnow.php, due to inadequate session checking when
triggering the import of IMS Enterprise identities (CVE-2014-0126).");
