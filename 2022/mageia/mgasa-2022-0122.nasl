  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This kernel-linus update is based on upstream 5.15.32 and fixes at least
the following security issues:

An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's
watch_queue event notification subsystem. This flaw can overwrite parts
of the kernel state, potentially allowing a local user to gain privileged
access or cause a denial of service on the system (CVE-2022-0995).

A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel FUSE filesystem was found in
the way user triggers write(). A local user could use this flaw to get
some unauthorized access to some data from the FUSE filesystem and as
result potentially privilege escalation too (CVE-2022-1011).

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c
of the netfilter subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to cause an
out-of-bounds write issue (CVE-2022-1015).

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:
nft_do_chain, which can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle
'return' with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information
leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker (CVE-2022-1016).

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's sound subsystem in
the way a user triggers concurrent calls of PCM hw_params. The hw_free
ioctls or similar race condition happens inside ALSA PCM for other ioctls.
This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their
privileges on the system (CVE-2022-1048).

st21nfca_connectivity_event_received in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c has
EVT_TRANSACTION buffer overflows because of untrusted length parameters
(CVE-2022-26490).

There is a buffer overflow in ESP transformation in net/ipv4/esp4.c and
net/ipv6/esp6.c via a large message. In some configurations, local users
can gain privileges by overwriting kernel heap objects (CVE-2022-27666).

A refcount leak bug was found in net/llc/af_llc.c (CVE-2022-28356).

For other upstream fixes, see the referenced changelogs.");
