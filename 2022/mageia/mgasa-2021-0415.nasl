An assertion failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata
of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim
into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file (CVE-2021-32815).

An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a
crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
Exiv2 on a crafted image file (CVE-2021-34334).

A floating point exception (FPE) due to an integer divide by zero was found
in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The FPE is triggered when Exiv2 is
used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could
potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they
can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file
(CVE-2021-34335).
