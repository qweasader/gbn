  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x
before 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific
property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the
mysql-connector-java jar (8.0.14 or earlier) in the classpath, and an attacker
can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim, an attacker can send
a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the
server. This occurs because of missing com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin
validation (CVE-2019-12086).

FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.1 might allow attackers to have a
variety of impacts by leveraging failure to block the logback-core class from
polymorphic deserialization. Depending on the classpath content, remote code
execution may be possible (CVE-2019-12384).

A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x
through 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific
property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has JDOM
1.x or 2.x jar in the classpath, an attacker can send a specifically crafted
JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server
(CVE-2019-12814).

SubTypeValidator.java in FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.9.9.2 mishandles
default typing when ehcache is used (because of
net.sf.ehcache.transaction.manager.DefaultTransactionManagerLookup),
leading to remote code execution (CVE-2019-14379).

A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x
before 2.9.9.2. This occurs when Default Typing is enabled (either globally or
for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the
service has the logback jar in the classpath (CVE-2019-14439).

A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind before
2.9.10. It is related to com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig (CVE-2019-14540).

A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind before
2.9.10. It is related to com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource. This is a different
vulnerability than CVE-2019-14540 (CVE-2019-16335).

A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.0.0
through 2.9.10. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a
specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has
the commons-dbcp (1.4) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can find an RMI
service endpoint to access, it is possible to make the service execute a
malicious payload. This issue exists because of
org.apache.commons.dbcp.datasources.SharedPoolDataSource and
org.apache.commons.dbcp.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource mishandling
(CVE-2019-16942).

A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.0.0
