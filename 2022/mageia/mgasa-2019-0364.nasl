An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists when loading
a PCX file in SDL2_image, version 2.0.4. A missing error handler can lead
to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide
a specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability.
(CVE-2019-5051)

An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX
file in SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer
overflow, resulting in too little memory being allocated, which can lead
to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. (CVE-2019-5052)

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the PCX image
rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted PCX image
can cause a heap overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can
display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
(CVE-2019-5057)

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image
rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XCF
image can cause a heap overflow, resulting in code execution.
(CVE-2019-5058)

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image
rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image
can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This
buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow,
ultimately ending in code execution. (CVE-2019-5059)

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image
rendering function of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image
can cause an integer overflow in the colorhash function, allocating too
small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds,
resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution.
