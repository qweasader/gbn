vulnerabilities:

The ModelAdmin.readonly_fields attribute in the Django admin allows
displaying model fields and model attributes. While the former were correctly
escaped, the latter were not. Thus untrusted content could be injected into
the admin, presenting an exploitation vector for XSS attacks (CVE-2015-2241).

Django relies on user input in some cases to redirect the user to an 'on
success' URL. The security checks for these redirects accepted URLs with
leading control characters and so considered URLs like \x08javascript:...
safe. This issue doesn't affect Django currently, however, if a developer
relies on is_safe_url() to provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL
into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack as some browsers such as
Google Chrome ignore control characters at the start of a URL in an anchor
href (CVE-2015-2317).

Note that the CVE-2015-2241 issue does not affect python-django14 directly,
but client code using it may be affected. Please see the March 9th upstream
advisory for more information on this.");
