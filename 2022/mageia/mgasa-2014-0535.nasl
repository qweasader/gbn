Pwgen was found to silently falling back to use standard pseudo generated
numbers on the systems that heavily use entropy. Systems, such as those with
a lot of daemons providing encryption services, the entropy was found to be
exhausted, which forces pwgen to fall back to use standard pseudo generated
