  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting
weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with
access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that
will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis
user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures
that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can
affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time.
Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long
time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not
endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs
in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged
users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a
privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis
versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this
problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is
not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands
using ACL rules. (CVE-2022-24735)

Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Prior to versions
6.2.7 and 7.0.0, an attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua
script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash
of the redis-server process. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0
and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without
patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used,
is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.
