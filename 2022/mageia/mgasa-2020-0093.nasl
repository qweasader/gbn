* A vulnerability was found in GNU patch through 2.7.6 is vulnerable to
 OS shell command injection that can be exploited by opening a crafted
 patch file that contains an ed style diff payload with shell
 metacharacters (CVE-2019-13638).

* A vulnerability was found in do_ed_script in pch.c in GNU patch through
 2.7.6 does not block strings beginning with a ! character. NOTE: this
 is the same commit as for CVE-2019-13638, but the ! syntax is specific to
 ed, and is unrelated to a shell metacharacter (CVE-2018-20969).");
