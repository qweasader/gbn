The SkBitmap::ReadRawPixels function in core/SkBitmap.cpp in the filters
implementation in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via vectors that trigger an out-of-bounds write operation
(CVE-2015-1213).

Integer overflow in the SkAutoSTArray implementation in
include/core/SkTemplates.h in the filters implementation in Skia, as used in
Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger
a reset action with a large count value, leading to an out-of-bounds write
operation (CVE-2015-1214).

The filters implementation in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before
41.0.2272.76, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger an
out-of-bounds write operation (CVE-2015-1215).

Use-after-free vulnerability in the V8Window::namedPropertyGetterCustom
function in bindings/core/v8/custom/V8WindowCustom.cpp in the V8 bindings in
Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
vectors that trigger a frame detachment (CVE-2015-1216).

The V8LazyEventListener::prepareListenerObject function in
bindings/core/v8/V8LazyEventListener.cpp in the V8 bindings in Blink, as used
in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, does not properly compile listeners,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors that leverage 'type confusion'
(CVE-2015-1217).

Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in the DOM implementation in Blink,
as used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, allow remote attackers to cause
a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors
that trigger movement of a SCRIPT element to different documents, related to
the HTMLScriptElement::didMoveToNewDocument function in
core/html/HTMLScriptElement.cpp and the
SVGScriptElement::didMoveToNewDocument function in
core/svg/SVGScriptElement.cpp (CVE-2015-1218).

Integer overflow in the SkMallocPixelRef::NewAllocate function in
core/SkMallocPixelRef.cpp in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before
41.0.2272.76, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger an attempted
allocation of a large amount of memory during WebGL rendering
(CVE-2015-1219).

Use-after-free vulnerability in the GIFImageReader::parseData function in
platform/image-decoders/gif/GIFImageReader.cpp in Blink, as used in Google
Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted frame size in
a GIF ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
