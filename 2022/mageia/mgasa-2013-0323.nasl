Multiple input checking flaws were found in the 2D component native image
parsing code. A specially crafted image file could trigger a Java Virtual
Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running the Java Virtual Machine
(CVE-2013-5782).

The class loader did not properly check the package access for non-public
proxy classes. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Java Virtual
Machine (CVE-2013-5830).

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the 2D, CORBA,
JNDI, and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or
applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions
(CVE-2013-5829, CVE-2013-5814, CVE-2013-5817, CVE-2013-5842, CVE-2013-5850).

Multiple input checking flaws were discovered in the JPEG image reading and
writing code in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet
could use these flaws to corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and bypass
Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-5809).

The FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING setting was not properly honored by the
javax.xml.transform package transformers. A remote attacker could use this
flaw to supply a crafted XML that would be processed without the intended
security restrictions (CVE-2013-5802).

Multiple errors were discovered in the way the JAXP and Security components
processes XML inputs. A remote attacker could create a crafted XML that
would cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory
when processed (CVE-2013-5825, CVE-2013-4002, CVE-2013-5823).

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Libraries,
Swing, JAX-WS, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting components in OpenJDK. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass
certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-3829, CVE-2013-5840,
CVE-2013-5774, CVE-2013-5783, CVE-2013-5820, CVE-2013-5849, CVE-2013-5790,
CVE-2013-5784).

It was discovered that the 2D component image library did not properly
check bounds when performing image conversions. An untrusted Java
application or applet could use this flaw to disclose portions of the Java
Virtual Machine memory (CVE-2013-5778).

Multiple input sanitization flaws were discovered in javadoc. When javadoc
documentation was generated from an untrusted Java source code and hosted
on a domain not controlled by the code author, these issues could make it
easier to perform cross-site scripting attacks (CVE-2013-5804,
CVE-2013-5797).

Various OpenJDK classes that represent cryptographic keys could leak
private key information by including sensitive data in strings returned by
toString() methods. These flaws could possibly lead to an unexpected
exposure of sensitive key data ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
