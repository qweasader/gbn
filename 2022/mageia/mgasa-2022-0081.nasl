Fix stack exhaustion in doctype parsing that could be triggered by e.g. a
2 megabytes file with a large number of opening braces. Expected impact
is denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.

Fix integer overflow in function copyString, only affects the encoding
name parameter at parser creation time which is often hardcoded (rather
than user input), takes a value in the gigabytes to trigger, and a 64-bit
machine. Expected impact is denial of service. (CVE-2022-25314)
