  Notes:

  - For a successful detection of this flaw a Linux/Unixoide target host needs to be able to reach
  the scanner host on a TCP port randomly generated during the runtime of the VT (currently in the
  range of 10000-32000). If the target host is a Windows system the target needs (to be able) to
  answer on ICMP Echo requests.

  - Per default the script checks just for sample apps (like functionRouter) and only within five
  directories. If you would like to run on every found web application and directory (which might
  cause longer run/scan time) set the 'Enable generic web application scanning' setting within the
  VT 'Global variable settings' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.12288) to 'yes'.");
