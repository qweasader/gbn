  squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default
  curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered
  unlikely and include reusing private keys.  Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as
  a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks
  against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work
  necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of
  resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be
  meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no
  longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.");
