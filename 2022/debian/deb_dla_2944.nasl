CVE-2022-26495

In nbd-server in nbd before 3.24, there is an integer overflow with a resultant heap-based buffer overflow. A value of 0xffffffff in the name length field will cause a zero-sized buffer to be allocated for the name, resulting in a write to a dangling pointer. This issue exists for the NBD_OPT_INFO, NBD_OPT_GO, and NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME messages.

For Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 1:3.15.2-3+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.

Thanks to Wouter Verhelst for help in preparing this update.
