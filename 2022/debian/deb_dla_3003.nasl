CVE-2022-24836

CVE-2022-24836: Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for Ruby. Nokogiri `< v1.13.4` contains an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to detect encoding in HTML documents. Users are advised to upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.4`. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

For Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 1.6.8.1-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-nokogiri packages.
