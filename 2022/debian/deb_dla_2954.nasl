HTTP cookies were not bound to a single domain and were instead sent to every domain.

CVE-2022-23607

treq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of Twisted's Agents. Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`, etc.) and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor accept cookies as a dictionary. Such cookies are not bound to a single domain, and are therefore sent to *every* domain ('supercookies'). This can potentially cause sensitive information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain., e.g. should `[link moved to references]` redirect to `[link moved to references]` the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`, `HTTPClient.request`, `HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade Instead of passing a dictionary as the *cookies* argument, pass a `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-scoped cookies in it.

For Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 15.1.0-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-treq packages.
