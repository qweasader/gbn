  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in lrzip, a compression program. Invalid pointers, use-after-free and infinite loops would allow attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact via a crafted compressed file.

CVE-2018-5786

There is an infinite loop and application hang in the get_fileinfo function (lrzip.c). Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted lrz file.

CVE-2020-25467

A null pointer dereference was discovered lzo_decompress_buf in stream.c which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DOS) via a crafted compressed file.

CVE-2021-27345

A null pointer dereference was discovered in ucompthread in stream.c which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via a crafted compressed file.

CVE-2021-27347

Use after free in lzma_decompress_buf function in stream.c in allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted compressed file.

CVE-2022-26291

lrzip was discovered to contain a multiple concurrency use-after-free between the functions zpaq_decompress_buf() and clear_rulist(). This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted lrz file.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 0.631-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your lrzip packages.

For the detailed security status of lrzip please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be found at: [link moved to references]");
