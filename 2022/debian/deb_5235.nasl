CVE-2022-2795

Yehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr and Shani Stajnrod discovered that a flaw in the resolver code can cause named to spend excessive amounts of time on processing large delegations, significantly degrade resolver performance and result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-3080

Maksym Odinintsev discovered that the resolver can crash when stale cache and stale answers are enabled with a zero stale-answer-timeout. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via specially crafted queries to the resolver.

CVE-2022-38177

It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2022-38178

It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in version 1:9.16.33-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.

For the detailed security status of bind9 please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]");
