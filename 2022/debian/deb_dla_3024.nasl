Untrusted data was used as a tolerance parameter in GIS functions and aggregates when using the Oracle database backend. By passing a suitably crafted tolerance to GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle, it was potentially possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

CVE-2020-9402

Django 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a tolerance parameter in GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle. By passing a suitably crafted tolerance to GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

For Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 1:1.10.7-2+deb9u17.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
