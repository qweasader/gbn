  configuration, which have the same driver and args settings, the incorrect username_filter and
  mechanism settings can be applied to passdb definitions. These incorrectly applied settings can
  lead to an unintended security configuration and can permit privilege escalation with certain
  configurations involving master user authentication.

  Dovecot documentation does not advise against the use of passdb definitions which have the same
  driver and args settings. One such configuration would be where an administrator wishes to use
  the same pam configuration or passwd file for both normal and master users but use the
  username_filter setting to restrict which of the users is able to be a master user.");
