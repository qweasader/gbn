  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for libcontainers-common fixes the following issues:

libcontainers-common was updated:

common component was updated to 0.44.0.

storage component was updated to 1.36.0.

image component was updated to 5.16.0.

podman component was updated to 3.3.1.

3.3.1:

Bugfixes:

Fixed a bug where unit files created by `podman generate systemd` could
 not cleanup shut down containers when stopped by `systemctl stop` .

Fixed a bug where `podman machine` commands would not properly locate
 the `gvproxy` binary in some circumstances.

Fixed a bug where containers created as part of a pod using the
 `--pod-id-file` option would not join the pod's network namespace .

Fixed a bug where Podman, when using the systemd cgroups driver, could
 sometimes leak dbus sessions.

Fixed a bug where the `until` filter to `podman logs` and `podman
 events` was improperly handled, requiring input to be negated .

Fixed a bug where rootless containers using CNI networking run on
 systems using `systemd-resolved` for DNS would fail to start if resolved
 symlinked `/etc/resolv.conf` to an absolute path .

API:

A large number of potential file descriptor leaks from improperly
 closing client connections have been fixed.

3.3.0:

Features:

Containers inside VMs created by `podman machine` will now automatically
 handle port forwarding - containers in `podman machine` VMs that publish
 ports via `--publish` or `--publish-all` will have these ports not just
 forwarded on the VM, but also on the host system.

The `podman play kube` command's `--network` option now accepts advanced
 network options (e.g. `--network slirp4netns:port_handler=slirp4netns`) .

The `podman play kube` commmand now supports Kubernetes liveness probes,
 which will be created as Podman healthchecks.

Podman now provides a systemd unit, `podman-restart.service`, which,
 when enabled, will restart all containers that were started with
 `--restart=always` after the system reboots.

Rootless Podman can now be configured to use CNI networking by default
 by using the `rootless_networking` option in `containers.conf`.

Images can now be pulled using `image:tag@digest` syntax (e.g. `podman
 pull fedora:34@sha256:1b0d4ddd99b1a8c8a80e885aafe6034c95f266da44ead992aab388e6aa
 91611a`) .

The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore`
 commands can now be used to checkpoint containers that are in pods, and
 restore those containers into pods.

The `podman container restore` command now features a new option,
 `--publish`, to change the ports that are forwarded to a container that
 is being restored from an exported checkpoint.

The `podman container checkpoint` command now features a new option,
 `--compress`, to specify the compression algorithm that will be used on
 the generated checkpoint.

The `podman pull` command can now pull multiple images at once (e.g.
 `podman pull fedora:34 ubi8:latest` will pull both ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
