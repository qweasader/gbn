The following security bugs were fixed:

CVE-2022-0854: Fixed a memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernels
 DMA subsystem. This flaw allowed a local user to read random memory from
 the kernel space. (bnc#1196823)

CVE-2022-1016: Fixed a vulnerability in the nf_tables component of the
 netfilter subsystem. This vulnerability gives an attacker a powerful
 primitive that can be used to both read from and write to relative stack
 data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. (bsc#1197227)

CVE-2022-1199: Fixed null-ptr-deref and use-after-free vulnerabilities
 that allow an attacker to crash the linux kernel by simulating Amateur
 Radio. (bsc#1198028)

CVE-2022-1205: Fixed null pointer dereference and use-after-free
 vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to crash the linux kernel by
 simulating Amateur Radio. (bsc#1198027)

CVE-2022-1198: Fixed an use-after-free vulnerability that allow an
 attacker to crash the linux kernel by simulating Amateur Radio
 (bsc#1198030).

CVE-2022-1195: Fixed an use-after-free vulnerability which could allow a
 local attacker with a user privilege to execute a denial of service.
 (bsc#1198029)

CVE-2022-28389: Fixed a double free in drivers/net/can/usb/mcba_usb.c
 vulnerability in the Linux kernel. (bnc#1198033)

CVE-2022-28388: Fixed a double free in drivers/net/can/usb/usb_8dev.c
 vulnerability in the Linux kernel. (bnc#1198032)

CVE-2022-28390: Fixed a double free in drivers/net/can/usb/ems_usb.c
 vulnerability in the Linux kernel. (bnc#1198031)

CVE-2022-1048: Fixed a race Condition in snd_pcm_hw_free leading to
 use-after-free due to the AB/BA lock with buffer_mutex and mmap_lock.
 (bsc#1197331)

CVE-2022-1055: Fixed a use-after-free in tc_new_tfilter that could allow
 a local attacker to gain privilege escalation. (bnc#1197702)

CVE-2022-0850: Fixed a kernel information leak vulnerability in
 iov_iter.c. (bsc#1196761)

CVE-2022-27666: Fixed a buffer overflow vulnerability in IPsec ESP
 transformation code. This flaw allowed a local attacker with a normal
 user privilege to overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local
 privilege escalation. (bnc#1197462)

CVE-2021-45868: Fixed a wrong validation check in fs/quota/quota_tree.c
 which could lead to an use-after-free if there is a corrupted quota
 file. (bnc#1197366)

CVE-2022-1011: Fixed an use-after-free vulnerability which could allow a
 local attacker to retireve (partial) /etc/shadow hashes or any other
 data from filesystem when he can mount a FUSE filesystems. (bnc#1197343)

CVE-2022-27223: Fixed an out-of-array access in
 /usb/gadget/udc/udc-xilinx.c. (bsc#1197245)

CVE-2021-39698: Fixed a possible memory corruption due to a use after
 free in aio_poll_complete_work. This could lead to local escalation of
 privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
