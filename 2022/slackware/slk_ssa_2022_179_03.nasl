Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/openssl-1.0.2u-i586-4_slack14.2.txz: Rebuilt.
 We're sending out the Slackware 14.2 updates again because the package
 build number wasn't incremented which caused slackpkg to not pick up the
 updates. It's been bumped and the packages rebuilt - otherwise there are
 no new changes. Thanks to John Jenkins for the report.
 For reference, here's the information from the previous advisory:
 In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in
 CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not
 properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were
 found by code review.
 When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there
 are other places in the script where the file names of certificates
 being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell.
