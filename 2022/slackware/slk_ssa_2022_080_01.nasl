mistakenly moved to a newer BIND branch. These packages do not fix any security
issues that weren't already fixed in the bind-9.18.1 packages, which have been
moved into /testing, but the BIND 9.16 LTS version is the correct one for
Slackware 15.0.


Here are the details from the Slackware 15.0 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/bind-9.16.27-i586-1_slack15.0.txz: Upgraded.
 Sorry folks, I had not meant to bump BIND to the newer branch. I've moved
 the other packages into /testing. Thanks to Nobby6 for pointing this out.
 This update fixes bugs and the following security issues:
 A synchronous call to closehandle_cb() caused isc__nm_process_sock_buffer()
 to be called recursively, which in turn left TCP connections hanging in the
 CLOSE_WAIT state blocking indefinitely when out-of-order processing was
 disabled.
 The rules for acceptance of records into the cache have been tightened to
 prevent the possibility of poisoning if forwarders send records outside
 the configured bailiwick.
