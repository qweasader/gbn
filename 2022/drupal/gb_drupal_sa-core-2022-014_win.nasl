  upload (reference: SA-CORE-2020-012) and strips leading and trailing dots from filenames to
  prevent uploading server configuration files (reference: SA-CORE-2019-010).

  However, the protections for these two vulnerabilities previously did not work correctly
  together. As a result, if the site were configured to allow the upload of files with an htaccess
  extension, these files' filenames would not be properly sanitized. This could allow bypassing the
  protections provided by Drupal core's default .htaccess files and possible remote code execution
  on Apache web servers.

  This issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires a field administrator to explicitly
  configure a file field to allow htaccess as an extension (a restricted permission), or a
  contributed module or custom code that overrides allowed file uploads.");
