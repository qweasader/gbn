A same-origin policy violation could have allowed the theft of cross-origin URL entries, leaking the result of a redirect, via performance.getEntries().

CVE-2022-42928: Memory Corruption in JS Engine
Certain types of allocations were missing annotations that, if the Garbage Collector was in a specific state, could have lead to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2022-46881: Memory corruption in WebGL
An optimization in WebGL was incorrect in some cases, and could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.Note: This advisory was added on December 13th, 2022 after we better understood the impact of the issue. The fix was included in the original release of Firefox 106.

CVE-2022-42929: Denial of Service via window.print
If a website called window.print() in a particular way, it could cause a denial of service of the browser, which may persist beyond browser restart depending on the user's session restore settings.

CVE-2022-42930: Race condition in DOM Workers
If two Workers were simultaneously initializing their CacheStorage, a data race could have occurred in the ThirdPartyUtil component.

CVE-2022-42931: Username saved to a plaintext file on disk
Logins saved by Firefox should be managed by the Password Manager component which uses encryption to save files on-disk. Instead, the username (not password) was saved by the Form Manager to an unencrypted file on disk.

CVE-2022-42932: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 106 and Firefox ESR 102.4
Mozilla developers Ashley Hale and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 105 and Firefox ESR 102.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-46885: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 106
Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Ashley Hale, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 105. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.");
