If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have auto-updated itself and while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the new requested permissions.

CVE-2022-22755: XSL could have allowed JavaScript execution after a tab was closed
By using XSL Transforms, a malicious webserver could have served a user an XSL document that would continue to execute JavaScript (within the bounds of the same-origin policy) even after the tab was closed.

CVE-2022-22756: Drag and dropping an image could have resulted in the dropped object being an executable
If a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the resulting object could have been changed into an executable script which would have run arbitrary code after the user clicked on it.

CVE-2022-22757: Remote Agent did not prevent local websites from connecting
Remote Agent, used in WebDriver, did not validate the Host or Origin headers. This could have allowed websites to connect back locally to the user's browser to control it. This bug only affected Firefox when WebDriver was enabled, which is not the default configuration.

CVE-2022-22759: Sandboxed iframes could have executed script if the parent appended elements
If a document created a sandboxed iframe without allow-scripts, and subsequently appended an element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event handler - the event handler would have run despite the iframe's sandbox.

CVE-2022-22760: Cross-Origin responses could be distinguished between script and non-script content-types
When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between application/javascript responses and non-script responses. This could have been abused to learn information cross-origin.

Web-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
