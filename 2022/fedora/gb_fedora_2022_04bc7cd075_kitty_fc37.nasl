  scrolling. Uses threaded rendering to minimize input latency.

  - Supports all modern terminal features: graphics (images), unicode, true-color,
  OpenType ligatures, mouse protocol, focus tracking, bracketed paste and
  several new terminal protocol extensions.

  - Supports tiling multiple terminal windows side by side in different layouts
  without needing to use an extra program like tmux.

  - Can be controlled from scripts or the shell prompt, even over SSH.

  - Has a framework for Kittens, small terminal programs that can be used to
  extend kitty&#39, s functionality. For example, they are used for Unicode input,
  Hints and Side-by-side diff.

  - Supports startup sessions which allow you to specify the window/tab layout,
  working directories and programs to run on startup.

  - Cross-platform: kitty works on Linux and macOS, but because it uses only
  OpenGL for rendering, it should be trivial to port to other Unix-like
  platforms.

  - Allows you to open the scrollback buffer in a separate window using arbitrary
  programs of your choice. This is useful for browsing the history comfortably
  in a pager or editor.

  - Has multiple copy/paste buffers, like vim.");
