files. Both PARTIAL and FULL compression levels are supported.

This package can be divided in three parts:

   The e00conv command-line program. This program takes a E00 file as input
    (compressed or not) and copies it to a new file with the requested
    compression level (NONE, PARTIAL or FULL).

   A set of library functions to read compressed E00 files. These functions
    read a E00 file (compressed or not) and return a stream of uncompressed
    lines, making the E00 file appear as if it was not compressed.

   A set of library functions to write compressed E00 files. These functions
    take one line after another from what should be a uncompressed E00 file,
    and write them to a file with the requested compression level, either NONE,
    PARTIAL or FULL.

This is a metapackage that installs both the command-line tools
(e00compr-tools) and the libraries (e00compr-libs).");
