  * Does not slow you down. If we can improve the productivity of an e-mail

  * Respects open standards and facilitates modern technologies. We value
    the vendor-neutrality that IMAP provides and are committed to be as
    inter-operable as possible.

  * Is efficient  be it at conserving the network bandwidth, keeping memory
    use at a reasonable level or not hogging the system&#39, s CPU.

  * Can be used on many platforms. One UI is not enough for everyone, but our
    IMAP core works fine on anything from desktop computers to cell phones
    and big ERP systems.

  * Plays well with the rest of the ecosystem. We don&#39, t like reinventing wheels,
    but when the existing wheels quite don&#39, t fit the tracks, we&#39, re not afraid
    of making them work.
