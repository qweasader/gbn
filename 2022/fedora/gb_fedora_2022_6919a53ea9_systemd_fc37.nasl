of the system. It provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket
and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of
daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount
and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based
service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a
replacement for sysvinit. Other parts of this package are a logging daemon,
utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname, date, locale,
maintain a list of logged-in users, system accounts, runtime directories and
settings, and a logging daemons.

This package was built from the 251.10-stable branch of systemd.");
