health and integrity of servers. Zabbix uses a flexible notification mechanism
that allows users to configure e-mail based alerts for virtually any event.
This allows a fast reaction to server problems. Zabbix offers excellent
reporting and data visualization features based on the stored data.
This makes Zabbix ideal for capacity planning.

Zabbix supports both polling and trapping. All Zabbix reports and statistics,
as well as configuration parameters are accessed through a web-based front end.
A web-based front end ensures that the status of your network and the health of
your servers can be assessed from any location. Properly configured, Zabbix can
play an important role in monitoring IT infrastructure. This is equally true
for small organizations with a few servers and for large companies with a
multitude of servers.");
