Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu
12.04 LTS.

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux
kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is
negatively instantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2015-8539)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the device
driver for XCeive xc2028/xc3028 tuners in the Linux kernel. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-7913)

Pengfei Ding (Ding Peng Fei ), Chenfu Bao (Bao Chen Fu ), and Lenx Wei (Wei Tao )
discovered a race condition in the generic SCSI driver (sg) of the Linux
kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0794)

Eric Biggers discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux
kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is
uninstantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15299)

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the
OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2017-18216)

Luo Quan and Wei Yang discovered that a race condition existed in the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel when
handling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system deadlock). (CVE-2018-1000004)

Fan Long Fei discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux
Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel that could lead to
a use- after-free or an out-of-bounds buffer access. A local attacker with
access to /dev/snd/seq could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7566)

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the NFC Logical Link
Control Protocol (llcp) implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-9518)");
