Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to the cgroups v1
release_agent feature. A local attacker could use this to gain
administrative privileges. (CVE-2022-0492)

Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB device driver
in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2021-43976)

Wenqing Liu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate inode types while performing garbage
collection. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image
that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2021-44879)

Samuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
(TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based
buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured.
(CVE-2022-0435)

Lyu Tao discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly handle requests to open a directory on a regular file. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2022-24448)

It was discovered that the YAM AX.25 device driver in the Linux kernel did
not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local privileged
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory
exhaustion). (CVE-2022-24959)");
