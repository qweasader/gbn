It was discovered that Thunderbird ignored the configuration to require
STARTTLS for an SMTP connection. A person-in-the-middle could potentially
exploit this to perform a downgrade attack in order to intercept messages
or take control of a session. (CVE-2021-38502)

It was discovered that JavaScript was unexpectedly enabled in the
composition area. An attacker could potentially exploit this in
combination with another vulnerability, with unspecified impacts.
(CVE-2021-43528)

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Matrix chat library bundled with
Thunderbird. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial
of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-44538)

It was discovered that Thunderbird's OpenPGP integration only considered
the inner signed message when checking signature validity in a message
that contains an additional outer MIME layer. An attacker could
potentially exploit this to trick the user into thinking that a message
has a valid signature. (CVE-2021-4126)");
