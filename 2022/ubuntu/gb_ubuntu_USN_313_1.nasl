A flaw was discovered in the Java sandbox which allowed Java applets
to break out of the sandbox and execute code without restrictions. By
tricking a user into opening a malicious document, this could be
exploited to run arbitrary code with the user's privileges. This
update disables Java applets for OpenOffice.org, since it is not
generally possible to guarantee the sandbox restrictions.

A buffer overflow has been found in the XML parser. By tricking a user
