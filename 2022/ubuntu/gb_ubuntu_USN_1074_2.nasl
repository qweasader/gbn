check certain parameters. A local attacker could exploit this gain root
privileges. (CVE-2010-3904)

Nelson Elhage discovered several problems with the Acorn Econet protocol
driver. A local user could cause a denial of service via a NULL pointer
dereference, escalate privileges by overflowing the kernel stack, and
assign Econet addresses to arbitrary interfaces. (CVE-2010-3848,
CVE-2010-3849, CVE-2010-3850)

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly filter
registers on 64bit kernels when performing 32bit system calls. On a 64bit
system, a local attacker could manipulate 32bit system calls to gain root
privileges. (CVE-2010-3301)

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly validate
memory ranges on 64bit kernels when allocating memory on behalf of 32bit
system calls. On a 64bit system, a local attacker could perform malicious
multicast getsockopt calls to gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-3081)

Al Viro discovered a race condition in the TTY driver. A local attacker
could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4895)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the MOVE_EXT ext4 ioctl did not correctly
check file permissions. A local attacker could overwrite append-only files,
leading to potential data loss. (CVE-2010-2066)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the swapexit xfs ioctl did not correctly
check file permissions. A local attacker could exploit this to read from
write-only files, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-2226)

Suresh Jayaraman discovered that CIFS did not correctly validate certain
response packets. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic
that would crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2010-2248)

Ben Hutchings discovered that the ethtool interface did not correctly check
certain sizes. A local attacker could perform malicious ioctl calls that
could crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-2478,
CVE-2010-3084)

James Chapman discovered that L2TP did not correctly evaluate checksum
capabilities. If an attacker could make malicious routing changes, they
could crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-2495)

Neil Brown discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly check certain write
requests. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic that could
crash the system or possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-2521)

David Howells discovered that DNS resolution in CIFS could be spoofed. A
local attacker could exploit this to control DNS replies, leading to a loss
of privacy and possible privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-2524)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the btrfs filesystem did not correctly
validate permissions when using the clone function. A local attacker could
overwrite the contents of file handles that were opened for append-only, or
