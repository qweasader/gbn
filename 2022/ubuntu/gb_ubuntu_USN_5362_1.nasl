offload functionality. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-25636)

Enrico Barberis, Pietro Frigo, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano
Giuffrida discovered that hardware mitigations added by ARM to their
processors to address Spectre-BTI were insufficient. A local attacker could
potentially use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-23960)

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not
properly restrict pointer types in certain situations. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-23222)

Max Kellermann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly handled Unix
pipes. A local attacker could potentially use this to modify any file that
could be opened for reading. (CVE-2022-0847)

Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang discovered that the cgroups implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to the cgroups v1
release_agent feature. A local attacker could use this to gain
administrative privileges. (CVE-2022-0492)

William Liu and Jamie Hill-Daniel discovered that the file system context
functionality in the Linux kernel contained an integer underflow
vulnerability, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-0185)

Enrico Barberis, Pietro Frigo, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano
Giuffrida discovered that hardware mitigations added by Intel to their
processors to address Spectre-BTI were insufficient. A local attacker could
potentially use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0001)

Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket
implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free.
A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)

It was discovered that the NFS server implementation in the Linux kernel
contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4090)

Kirill Tkhai discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the
Linux kernel did not calculate size correctly when pre-allocating space in
some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2021-4155)

It was discovered that the AMD Radeon GPU driver in the Linux kernel did
not properly validate writes in the debugfs file system. A privileged
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42327)
