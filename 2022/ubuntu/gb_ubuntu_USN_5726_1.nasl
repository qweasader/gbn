Armin Ebert discovered that Firefox did not properly manage while resolving
file symlink. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted weblink,
an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service.

If a user were tricked into downloading and executing malicious content, a
remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
invoking the programs. (CVE-2022-45415)

Erik Kraft, Martin Schwarzl, and Andrew McCreight discovered that Firefox
incorrectly handled keyboard events. An attacker could possibly use this
issue to perform a timing side-channel attack and possibly figure out which
keys are being pressed. (CVE-2022-45416)

Kagami discovered that Firefox did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly.
An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information about
