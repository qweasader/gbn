verify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of-
bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)

It was discovered that the device-mapper verity (dm-verity) driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly verify targets being loaded into the device-
mapper table. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2503)

Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated
packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a
remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)");
