could cause arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user

Quotes and other shell escape characters in titles and file names were
not handled in previous versions. (CAN-2004-1184)

Previous versions supported reading EPS data not only from a file, but
also from an arbitrary command pipe. Since checking for unwanted side
effects is infeasible, this feature has been disabled after
consultation with the authors of enscript. (CAN-2004-1185)

Finally, this update fixes two buffer overflows which were triggered by
certain input files. (CAN-2004-1186)

These issues can lead to privilege escalation if enscript is called
automatically from web server applications like viewcvs.");
