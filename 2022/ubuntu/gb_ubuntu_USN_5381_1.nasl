did not properly validate passed user register indices. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-1015)

It was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly initialize memory in some situations. A privileged local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2022-0494)

It was discovered that the DMA subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly ensure bounce buffers were completely overwritten by the DMA
device. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information
(kernel memory). (CVE-2022-0854)

Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE file system in the Linux kernel
contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-1011)

David Bouman discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use
this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-1016)

Hu Jiahui discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the Advanced
Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, leading to use-after-free
vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use these to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1048)

It was discovered that the USB Gadget file system interface in the Linux
kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-24958)

It was discovered that the ST21NFCA NFC driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly validate the size of certain data in EVT_TRANSACTION events. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-26490)

It was discovered that the USB SR9700 ethernet device driver for the Linux
kernel did not properly validate the length of requests from the device. A
physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive
information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26966)

It was discovered that the Xilinx USB2 device gadget driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate endpoint indices from the host. A
physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2022-27223)

Zhao Zi Xuan discovered that the 802.2 LLC type 2 driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly perform reference counting in some error conditions. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28356)");
