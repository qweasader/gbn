LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux
Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu
12.04 ESM.

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the
Flash-Friendly File System (f2fs) in the Linux kernel. An attacker could
construct a malicious file system that, when mounted, could cause a denial
of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2017-0750)

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0861)

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed
passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.
(CVE-2017-1000407)

Bo Zhang discovered that the netlink wireless configuration interface in
the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes when handling certain
requests. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12153)

Vitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the SCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly track reference counts when merging buffers. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2017-12190)

It was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly restrict key reads on negatively instantiated keys. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2017-12192)

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the sysfs interface
for the QLogic 24xx+ series SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local
privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2017-14051)

Otto Ebeling discovered that the memory manager in the Linux kernel did not
properly check the effective UID in some situations. A local attacker could
use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-14140)

It was discovered that the ATI Radeon framebuffer driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize a data structure returned to user space.
A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel
memory). (CVE-2017-14156)

ChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14489)

James Patrick-Evans discovered a race condition in the LEGO USB Infrared
Tower driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
