  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Zhenpeng Lin discovered that the network packet scheduler implementation in
the Linux kernel did not properly remove all references to a route filter
before freeing it in some situations. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-2588)

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not
prevent one nft object from referencing an nft set in another nft table,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-2586)

It was discovered that the implementation of POSIX timers in the Linux
kernel did not properly clean up timers in some situations. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2585)

It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly prevent writes to kernel objects in BPF_BTF_LOAD commands. A
privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0500)

Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A
local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)

It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a
use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-1679)

It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some
situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker
could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)

Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in
some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1789)

Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the NFC subsystem in the Linux
kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1974)

Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly prevent context switches from occurring during certain atomic
context operations. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1975)
