(CVE-2022-1679)

Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in
some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1789)

Qiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor
implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle an illegal
instruction in a guest, resulting in a null pointer dereference. An
attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1852)

Gerald Lee discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-
after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2022-1973)

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel
contained a buffer overflow in certain situations. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2078)

It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform
cleanup actions on multi-core shared buffers. A local attacker could
possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21123)

It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform
cleanup actions on microarchitectural fill buffers. A local attacker could
possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21125)

It was discovered that some Intel processors did not properly perform
cleanup during specific special register write operations. A local attacker
could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21166)

It was discovered that the virtio RPMSG bus driver in the Linux kernel
contained a double-free vulnerability in certain error conditions. A local
attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2022-34494, CVE-2022-34495)

Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A
local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)");
