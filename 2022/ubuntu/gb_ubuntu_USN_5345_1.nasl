It was discovered that extensions of a particular type could auto-update
themselves and bypass the prompt that requests permissions. If a user
were tricked into installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions.
(CVE-2022-22754)

It was discovered that dragging and dropping an image into a folder could
result in it being marked as executable. If a user were tricked into
dragging and dropping a specially crafted image, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-22756)

It was discovered that files downloaded to /tmp were accessible to other
users. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive
information. (CVE-2022-26386)

A TOCTOU bug was discovered when verifying addon signatures during
install. A local attacker could potentially exploit this to trick a
user into installing an addon with an invalid signature.

specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit this
to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0566)");
