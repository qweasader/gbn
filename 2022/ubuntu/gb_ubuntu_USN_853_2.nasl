Original advisory details:

 Alin Rad Pop discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in Firefox when it
 converted strings to floating point numbers. If a user were tricked into
 viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service
 or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the
 program. (CVE-2009-1563)

 Jeremy Brown discovered that the Firefox Download Manager was vulnerable to
 symlink attacks. A local attacker could exploit this to create or overwrite
 files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2009-3274)

 Paul Stone discovered a flaw in the Firefox form history. If a user were
 tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could access this
 data to steal confidential information. (CVE-2009-3370)

 Orlando Berrera discovered that Firefox did not properly free memory when using
 web-workers. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote
 attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code
 with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only
 affected Ubuntu 9.10. (CVE-2009-3371)

 A flaw was discovered in the way Firefox processed Proxy Auto-configuration
 (PAC) files. If a user configured the browser to use PAC files with certain
 regular expressions, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
 (CVE-2009-3372)

 A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in Mozilla's GIF image parser. If a
 user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could
 cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2009-3373)

 A flaw was discovered in the JavaScript engine of Firefox. An attacker could
 exploit this to execute scripts from page content with chrome privileges.
 (CVE-2009-3374)

 Gregory Fleischer discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be
 bypassed by utilizing the document.getSelection function. An attacker could
 exploit this to read data from other domains. (CVE-2009-3375)

 Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm discovered that Firefox did not properly display
 filenames containing right-to-left (RTL) override characters. If a user were
 tricked into downloading a malicious file with a crafted filename, an attacker
 could exploit this to trick the user into opening a different file than the
 user expected. (CVE-2009-3376)

 Several flaws were discovered in third party media libraries. If a user were
 tricked into opening a crafted media file, a remote attacker could ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
