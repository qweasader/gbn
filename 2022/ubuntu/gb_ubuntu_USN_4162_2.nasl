It was discovered that the RSI 91x Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not
did not handle detach operations correctly, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2018-21008)

Wen Huang discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform bounds checking, leading to a heap
overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14814,
CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816)

Matt Delco discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform bounds checking when handling coalesced
MMIO write operations. A local attacker with write access to /dev/kvm could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-14821)

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the
Linux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2019-15117)

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the
Linux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta
data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15118)

It was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the
Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15505)

Brad Spengler discovered that a Spectre mitigation was improperly
implemented in the ptrace subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker
could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15902)

It was discovered that the SMB networking file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. An attacker could use this to
expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-15918)");
