LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux
Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu
12.04 ESM.

USN 3335-2 fixed a vulnerability in the Linux kernel. However, that
fix introduced regressions for some Java applications. This update
addresses the issue. We apologize for the inconvenience.

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability in the core voltage
regulator driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-9940)

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the trace subsystem in
the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could use this to execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0605)

Roee Hay discovered that the parallel port printer driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly bounds check passed arguments. A local attacker
with write access to the kernel command line arguments could use this to
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-1000363)

Li Qiang discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the
Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux
kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7294)

It was discovered that a double-free vulnerability existed in the IPv4
stack of the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2017-8890)

Andrey Konovalov discovered an IPv6 out-of-bounds read error in the Linux
kernel's IPv6 stack. A local attacker could cause a denial of service or
potentially other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9074)

Andrey Konovalov discovered a flaw in the handling of inheritance in the
Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this issue to cause a
denial of service or possibly other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9075)

It was discovered that dccp v6 in the Linux kernel mishandled inheritance.
A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or
potentially other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9076)

It was discovered that the transmission control protocol (tcp) v6 in the
Linux kernel mishandled inheritance. A local attacker could exploit this
issue to cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified
problems. (CVE-2017-9077)

It was discovered that the IPv6 stack in the Linux kernel was performing
its over write consistency check after the data was actually overwritten. A
local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2017-9242)");
