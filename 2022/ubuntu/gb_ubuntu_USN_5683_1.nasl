verify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of-
bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33655)

Selim Enes Karaduman discovered that a race condition existed in the
General notification queue implementation of the Linux kernel, leading to a
use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-1882)

Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling
implementation of the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in
use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)

Roger Pau Monne discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)

Pawan Kumar Gupta, Alyssa Milburn, Amit Peled, Shani Rehana, Nir Shildan
and Ariel Sabba discovered that some Intel processors with Enhanced
Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) did not properly handle RET
instructions after a VM exits. A local attacker could potentially use this
to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-26373)

Eric Biggers discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3176)

Roger Pau Monne discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the
Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-33740)

It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux
kernel incorrectly shared unrelated data when communicating with certain
backends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).
(CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742)

Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen network device frontend driver in the
Linux kernel incorrectly handled socket buffers (skb) references when
communicating with certain backends. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2022-33743)

Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that the Xen paravirtualization platform in
the Linux kernel on ARM platforms contained a race condition in certain
situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of
service in the host OS. (CVE-2022-33744)
