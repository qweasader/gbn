Unfortunately, that update introduced a regression in OpenJDK 11 that
could impact interoperability with some popular HTTP/2 servers making
it unable to connect to said servers. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled deserialization filters.
 An attacker could possibly use this issue to insert, delete or obtain
 sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21248)

 It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly read uncompressed TIFF files.
 An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service via
 a specially crafted TIFF file. (CVE-2022-21277)

 Jonni Passki discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly verified access
 restrictions when performing URI resolution. An attacker could possibly
 use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21282)

 It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain regular
 expressions in the Pattern class implementation. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21283)

 It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled specially crafted Java
 class files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial
 of service. (CVE-2022-21291)

 Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated attributes
 during object deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue
 to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21293, CVE-2022-21294)

 Dan Rabe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly verified access permissions
 in the JAXP component. An attacker could possibly use this to specially
 craft an XML file to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21296)

 It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled XML entities. An
 attacker could use this to specially craft an XML file that, when parsed,
 would possibly cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21299)

 Zhiqiang Zang discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled array indexes.
 An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.
 (CVE-2022-21305)

 It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly read very long attributes
 values in JAR file manifests. An attacker could possibly use this to
 specially craft JAR file to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21340)

 It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated input from serialized
 streams. An attacker cold possibly use this issue to bypass sandbox
 restrictions. (CVE-2022-21341)

 Fabian Meumertzheim discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain
 specially crafted BMP or TIFF files. An attacker could possibly use this
 to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21360, CVE-2022-21366)

 It was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in OpenJDK
 BMPImageReader class implementation. An attacker could possibly use this
 to specially craft a BMP file to cause a denial of service.
