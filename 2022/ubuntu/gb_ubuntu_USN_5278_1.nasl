kernel did not properly perform reference counting, leading to a use-after-
free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-24122)

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not
properly restrict pointer types in certain situations. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-23222)

Jeremy Cline discovered a use-after-free in the nouveau graphics driver of
the Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged or physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2020-27820)

It was discovered that the Packet network protocol implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a double-free vulnerability. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22600)

Jurgen Gross discovered that the Xen subsystem within the Linux kernel did
not adequately limit the number of events driver domains (unprivileged PV
backends) could send to other guest VMs. An attacker in a driver domain
could use this to cause a denial of service in other guest VMs.
(CVE-2021-28713)

Jurgen Gross discovered that the Xen network backend driver in the Linux
kernel did not adequately limit the amount of queued packets when a guest
did not process them. An attacker in a guest VM can use this to cause a
denial of service (excessive kernel memory consumption) in the network
backend domain. (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)

Szymon Heidrich discovered that the USB Gadget subsystem in the Linux
kernel did not properly restrict the size of control requests for certain
gadget types, leading to possible out of bounds reads or writes. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39685)

It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition around read-only maps. A privileged attacker
could use this to modify read-only maps. (CVE-2021-4001)

Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket
implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free.
A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)

It was discovered that the simulated networking device driver for the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2021-4135)

Kirill Tkhai discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the
Linux kernel did not calculate size correctly when pre-allocating space in
some situations. A local attacker could use this to ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
