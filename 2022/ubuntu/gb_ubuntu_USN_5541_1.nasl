in the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some
situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative
privileges. (CVE-2021-4197)

Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE file system in the Linux kernel
contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-1011)

Duoming Zhou discovered that the 6pack protocol implementation in the Linux
kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to
a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1198)

Duoming Zhou discovered that the AX.25 amateur radio protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in
some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1199)

Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local
attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2022-1204)

Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to use-after-free
vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1205)

It was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker
could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2022-1353)

It was discovered that the implementation of X.25 network protocols in the
Linux kernel did not terminate link layer sessions properly. A local
attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2022-1516)

Zheyu Ma discovered that the Silicon Motion SM712 framebuffer driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle very small reads. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2380)

It was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in
the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading
to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28388)

It was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer interface
implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error
conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28389)");
