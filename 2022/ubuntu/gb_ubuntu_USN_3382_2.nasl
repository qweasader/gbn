Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that the PHP URL parser incorrectly handled certain URI
 components. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass
 hostname-specific URL checks. (CVE-2016-10397)

 It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain boolean parameters
 when unserializing data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
 cause PHP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-11143)

 Sebastian Li, Wei Lei, Xie Xiaofei, and Liu Yang discovered that PHP
 incorrectly handled the OpenSSL sealing function. A remote attacker could
 possibly use this issue to cause PHP to crash, resulting in a denial of
 service. (CVE-2017-11144)

 Wei Lei and Liu Yang discovered that the PHP date extension incorrectly
 handled memory. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to disclose
 sensitive information from the server. (CVE-2017-11145)

 It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain PHAR archives. A
 remote attacker could use this issue to cause PHP to crash or disclose
 sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
 (CVE-2017-11147)

 Wei Lei and Liu Yang discovered that PHP incorrectly handled parsing ini
 files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause PHP to crash,
 resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-11628)

 It was discovered that PHP mbstring incorrectly handled certain regular
 expressions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause PHP to crash,
 resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
