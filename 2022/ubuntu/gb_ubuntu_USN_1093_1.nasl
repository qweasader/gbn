check certain parameters. A local attacker could exploit this gain root
privileges. (CVE-2010-3904)

Nelson Elhage discovered several problems with the Acorn Econet protocol
driver. A local user could cause a denial of service via a NULL pointer
dereference, escalate privileges by overflowing the kernel stack, and
assign Econet addresses to arbitrary interfaces. (CVE-2010-3848,
CVE-2010-3849, CVE-2010-3850)

Ben Hutchings discovered that the ethtool interface did not correctly check
certain sizes. A local attacker could perform malicious ioctl calls that
could crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-2478,
CVE-2010-3084)

Eric Dumazet discovered that many network functions could leak kernel stack
contents. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of kernel
memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-2942, CVE-2010-3477)

Dave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not correctly order
inode lookups when exported by NFS. A remote attacker could exploit this to
read or write disk blocks that had changed file assignment or had become
unlinked, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-2943)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the IRDA subsystem did not correctly shut
down. A local attacker could exploit this to cause the system to crash or
possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-2954)

Brad Spengler discovered that the wireless extensions did not correctly
validate certain request sizes. A local attacker could exploit this to read
portions of kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-2955)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the session keyring did not correctly check
for its parent. On systems without a default session keyring, a local
attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2010-2960)

Kees Cook discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver did not correctly
validate memory regions. A local attacker with access to the video card
could read and write arbitrary kernel memory to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2010-2962)

Kees Cook discovered that the V4L1 32bit compat interface did not correctly
validate certain parameters. A local attacker on a 64bit system with access
to a video device could exploit this to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2010-2963)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the AIO subsystem did not correctly validate
certain parameters. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system
or possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-3067)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that certain XFS ioctls leaked kernel stack
contents. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of kernel
memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3078)

Robert Swiecki discovered that ftrace did not correctly handle mutexes. A
local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel, leading to a denial
of service. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
