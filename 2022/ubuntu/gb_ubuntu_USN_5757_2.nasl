It was discovered that the video4linux driver for Empia based TV cards in
the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some
situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3239)

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IPv6 implementation of
the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3524)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem
in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3564)

It was discovered that the ISDN implementation of the Linux kernel
contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged user could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-3565)

It was discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel contained
a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause
undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3566)

It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to
cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)

It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8152 USB Ethernet adapter driver in
the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local
attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device
to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3594)

It was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2
file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use
