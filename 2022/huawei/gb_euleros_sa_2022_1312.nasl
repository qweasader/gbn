  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"DENX U-Boot through 2018.09-rc1 has a locally exploitable buffer overflow via a crafted kernel image because filesystem loading is mishandled.(CVE-2018-18440)

Das U-Boot 2016.11-rc1 through 2019.04 mishandles the ext4 64-bit extension, resulting in a buffer overflow.(CVE-2019-11059)

gen_rand_uuid in lib/uuid.c in Das U-Boot v2014.04 through v2019.04 lacks an srand call, which allows attackers to determine UUID values in scenarios where CONFIG_RANDOM_UUID is enabled, and Das U-Boot is relied upon for UUID values of a GUID Partition Table of a boot device.(CVE-2019-11690)

A crafted self-referential DOS partition table will cause all Das U-Boot versions through 2019.07-rc4 to infinitely recurse, causing the stack to grow infinitely and eventually either crash or overwrite other data.(CVE-2019-13103)

In Das U-Boot versions 2016.11-rc1 through 2019.07-rc4, an underflow can cause memcpy() to overwrite a very large amount of data (including the whole stack) while reading a crafted ext4 filesystem.(CVE-2019-13104)

Das U-Boot versions 2016.09 through 2019.07-rc4 can memset() too much data while reading a crafted ext4 filesystem, which results in a stack buffer overflow and likely code execution.(CVE-2019-13106)

An issue was discovered in Das U-Boot through 2019.07. There is an unbounded memcpy when parsing a UDP packet due to a net_process_received_packet integer underflow during an nc_input_packet call.(CVE-2019-14192)

An issue was discovered in Das U-Boot through 2019.07. There is an unbounded memcpy with an unvalidated length at nfs_readlink_reply, in the 'if' block after calculating the new path length.(CVE-2019-14193)

An issue was discovered in Das U-Boot through 2019.07. There is an unbounded memcpy when parsing a UDP packet due to a net_process_received_packet integer underflow during an *udp_packet_handler call.(CVE-2019-14199)

An issue was discovered in Das U-Boot through 2019.07. There is an unbounded memcpy with a failed length check at nfs_read_reply when calling store_block in the NFSv2 case.(CVE-2019-14194)

An issue was discovered in Das U-Boot through 2019.07. There is an unbounded memcpy with a failed length check at nfs_read_reply when calling store_block in the NFSv3 case.(CVE-2019-14198)

An issue was discovered in Das U-Boot through 2019.07. There is an unbounded memcpy with unvalidated length at nfs_readlink_reply in the 'else' block after calculating the new path length.(CVE-2019-14195)

An issue was discovered in Das U-Boot through 2019.07. There is an unbounded memcpy with a failed length check at nfs_lookup_reply.(CVE-2019-14196)

An issue was discovered in Das U-Boot through 2019.07. There is a stack-based buffer overflow in this nfs_handler reply helper function: rpc_lookup_reply.(CVE-2019-14200)
