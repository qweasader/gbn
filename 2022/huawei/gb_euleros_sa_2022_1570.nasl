  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"ReadXBMImage in coders/xbm.c in ImageMagick before 7.0.8-9 leaves data uninitialized when processing an XBM file that has a negative pixel value. If the affected code is used as a library loaded into a process that includes sensitive information, that information sometimes can be leaked via the image data.(CVE-2018-16323)

In coders/bmp.c in ImageMagick before 7.0.8-16, an input file can result in an infinite loop and hang, with high CPU and memory consumption. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.(CVE-2018-20467)

In IntensityCompare() of /MagickCore/quantize.c, a double value was being casted to int and returned, which in some cases caused a value outside the range of type `int` to be returned. The flaw could be triggered by a crafted input file under certain conditions when processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low severity because although it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.(CVE-2020-27759)

In ImageMagick 7.0.7-29 and earlier, a memory leak in the formatIPTCfromBuffer function in coders/meta.c was found.(CVE-2018-16750)

WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the event logger. The patch replaces the hardcoded 256 value with a call to MagickMin() to ensure the proper value is used. This could impact application availability when a specially crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.(CVE-2020-25674)

A floating point math calculation in ScaleAnyToQuantum() of /MagickCore/quantum-private.h could lead to undefined behavior in the form of a value outside the range of type unsigned long long. The flaw could be triggered by a crafted input file under certain conditions when it is processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low because although it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.(CVE-2020-27757)

In CatromWeights(), MeshInterpolate(), InterpolatePixelChannel(), InterpolatePixelChannels(), and InterpolatePixelInfo(), which are all functions in /MagickCore/pixel.c, there were multiple unconstrained pixel offset calculations which were being used with the floor() function. These calculations produced undefined behavior in the form of out-of-range and integer overflows, as identified by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. These instances of undefined behavior ...
