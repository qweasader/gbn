  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel&rsquo,s TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.(CVE-2022-0435)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1.(CVE-2022-0487)

A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2022-0330)

A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's EBPF verifier when handling internal data structures. Internal memory locations could be returned to userspace. A local attacker with the permissions to insert eBPF code to the kernel can use this to leak internal kernel memory details defeating some of the exploit mitigations in place for the kernel.(CVE-2021-4159)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vmw_execbuf_copy_fence_user function in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_execbuf.c in vmwgfx. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a privilege escalation problem.(CVE-2022-22942)

A flaw was found in the sctp_make_strreset_req function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the SCTP network protocol in the Linux kernel with a local user privilege access. In this flaw, an attempt to use more buffer than is allocated triggers a BUG_ON issue, leading to a denial of service (DOS).(CVE-2022-0322)

An Out-of-Bounds Read was discovered in arch/arm/mach-footbridge/personal-pci.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.11 because of the lack of a check for a value that shouldn't be negative, e.g., access to element -2 of an array, aka CID-298a58e165e4.(CVE-2021-32078)

A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11. This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory object.(CVE-2021-44733)

An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO<pipe>VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local privilege escalation.(CVE-2021-22543)

Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.(CVE-2021-33098)
