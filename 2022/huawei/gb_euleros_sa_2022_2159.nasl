  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to crash the Linux kernel by simulating amateur radio from the user space, resulting in a null-ptr-deref vulnerability and a use-after-free vulnerability.(CVE-2022-1199)

kernel: Null pointer dereference and use after free in net/ax25/ax25_timer.c.(CVE-2022-1205)

In the Linux kernel before 5.17.3, fs/io_uring.c has a use-after-free due to a race condition in io_uring timeouts. This can be triggered by a local user who has no access to any user namespace, however, the race condition perhaps can only be exploited infrequently.(CVE-2022-29582)

In mmc_blk_read_single of block.c, there is a possible way to read kernel heap memory due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure if reading from an SD card that triggers errors, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-20008)

Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information.(CVE-2022-23960)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's X.25 set of standardized network protocols functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a simulated Ethernet card and continued usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.(CVE-2022-1516)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drm_lease_held in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_lease.c in the Linux kernel due to a race problem. This flaw allows a local user privilege attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) or a kernel information leak.(CVE-2022-1280)

Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.(CVE-2022-0001)

Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.(CVE-2022-0002)

In aio_poll_complete_work of aio.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-185125206References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2021-39698)

A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.(CVE-2022-0854)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's network scheduling subsystem due to a race condition. This flaw ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
