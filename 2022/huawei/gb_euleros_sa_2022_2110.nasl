No description is available for this CVE.(CVE-2022-1205)

In the Linux kernel before 5.17.3, fs/io_uring.c has a use-after-free due to a race condition in io_uring timeouts. This can be triggered by a local user who has no access to any user namespace, however, the race condition perhaps can only be exploited infrequently.(CVE-2022-29582)

In mmc_blk_read_single of block.c, there is a possible way to read kernel heap memory due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure if reading from an SD card that triggers errors, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-20008)

A new cache speculation vulnerability, known as Branch History Injection (BHI) or Spectre-BHB, was found in hw. Spectre-BHB is similar to Spectre v2, except that malicious code uses the shared branch history (stored in the CPU Branch History Buffer, or BHB) to influence mispredicted branches within the victim's hardware context. Once that occurs, speculation caused by the mispredicted branches can cause cache allocation. This issue leads to obtaining information that should not be accessible.(CVE-2022-23960)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's X.25 set of standardized network protocols functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a simulated Ethernet card and continued usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.(CVE-2022-1516)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drm_lease_held in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_lease.c in the Linux kernel due to a race problem. This flaw allows a local user privilege attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) or a kernel information leak.(CVE-2022-1280)

A flaw was found in hw. The Branch History Injection (BHI) describes a specific form of intra-mode BTI. This flaw allows an unprivileged attacker to manipulate the branch history before transitioning to supervisor or VMX root mode. This issue is an effort to cause an indirect branch predictor to select a specific predictor entry for an indirect branch, and a disclosure gadget at the predicted target will transiently execute. This execution is possible since the relevant branch history may contain branches taken in previous security contexts, and in particular, in other predictor modes.(CVE-2022-0001)

A flaw was found in hw. The Intra-mode BTI refers to a variant of Branch Target Injection aka SpectreV2 (BTI) where an indirect branch speculates to an aliased predictor entry for a different indirect branch in the same predictor mode, and a disclosure gadget at the predicted target transiently executes. These predictor entries may contain targets corresponding to the targets of an indirect near jump, indirect near call, and near return instructions, even if these branches were only transiently executed. ...
