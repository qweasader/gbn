  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag.(CVE-2022-30594)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The existing KVM SEV API has a vulnerability that allows a non-root (host) user-level application to crash the host kernel by creating a confidential guest VM instance in AMD CPU that supports Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV).(CVE-2022-0171)

Due to the small table perturb size, a memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TCP source port generation algorithm in the net/ipv4/tcp.c function. This flaw allows an attacker to leak information and may cause a denial of service.(CVE-2022-1012)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in drivers/net/hamradio. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service (DOS) when the mkiss or sixpack device is detached and reclaim resources early.(CVE-2022-1195)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drm_lease_held in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_lease.c in the Linux kernel due to a race problem. This flaw allows a local user privilege attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) or a kernel information leak.(CVE-2022-1280)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's X.25 set of standardized network protocols functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a simulated Ethernet card and continued usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.(CVE-2022-1516)

A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.(CVE-2022-0854)

In the Linux kernel before 5.17.1, a refcount leak bug was found in net/llc/af_llc.c.(CVE-2022-28356)

An information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c function in RPCRDMA_HDRLEN_MIN (7) (in rpcrdma_max_call_header_size, rpcrdma_max_reply_header_size). This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak kernel information.(CVE-2022-0812)

A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.(CVE-2022-1353)

A kernel information leak flaw was identified in the scsi_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special user privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to create issues with confidentiality.(CVE-2022-0494)

mcba_usb_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/mcba_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has a double free.(CVE-2022-28389)
