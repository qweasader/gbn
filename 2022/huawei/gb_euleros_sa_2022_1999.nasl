Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18, version 4.14 and later versions.(CVE-2022-29581)

The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag.(CVE-2022-30594)

Due to the small table perturb size, a memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TCP source port generation algorithm in the net/ipv4/tcp.c function. This flaw allows an attacker to leak information and may cause a denial of service.(CVE-2022-1012)

A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.(CVE-2022-1353)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drm_lease_held in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_lease.c in the Linux kernel due to a race problem. This flaw allows a local user privilege attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) or a kernel information leak.(CVE-2022-1280)

Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends [This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs, the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is ...
