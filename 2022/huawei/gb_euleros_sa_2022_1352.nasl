A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Google Android (Smartphone Operating System) (unknown version). This issue affects an unknown function of the component Kernel. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.(CVE-2021-0920)

Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.(CVE-2021-33098)

In bpf_skb_change_head of filter.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2021-0941)

A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.(CVE-2021-4037)

A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2021-4083)

A flaw memory leak in the Linux kernel's eBPF for the Simulated networking device driver in the way user uses BPF for the device such that function nsim_map_alloc_elem being called. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data.(CVE-2021-4135)

A flaw write out of memory bounds (1 or 2 bytes of memory) in the Linux kernel NFS subsystem was found in the way user uses mirroring (replication of files with NFS).A user if have access to NFS mount potentially could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system.(CVE-2021-4157)

net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_standalone.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.2 allows observation of changes in any net namespace because these changes are leaked into all other net namespaces. This is related to the NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX, NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX, and NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS sysctls.(CVE-2021-38209)

A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
