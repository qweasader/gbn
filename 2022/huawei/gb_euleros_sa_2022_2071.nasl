  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the ATI VGA implementation of the QEMU emulator. This flaw occurs in the ati_cursor_define() routine while handling MMIO write operations through ati_mm_write() callback. A malicious guest could abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2019-20808)

An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the bootp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'bootp_t' structure. A malicious guest could use this flaw to leak 10 bytes of uninitialized heap memory from the host. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2021-3592)

An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the udp6_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr' structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2021-3593)

This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2021-3594)

An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the tftp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'tftp_t' structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2021-3595)

An off-by-one error was found in the SCSI device emulation in QEMU. It could occur while processing MODE SELECT commands in mode_sense_page() if the 'page' argument was set to MODE_PAGE_ALLS (0x3f). A malicious guest could use this flaw to potentially crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition.(CVE-2021-3930)

An integer overflow was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's paravirtual RDMA device. The issue occurs while handling a 'PVRDMA_REG_DSRHIGH' write from the guest due to improper input validation. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to make QEMU allocate a large amount of memory, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3607)
