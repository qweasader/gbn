  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In various methods of kernel base drivers, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a heap buffer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-20166)

In lock_sock_nested of sock.c, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-20154)

An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the Linux kernel networking subsystem in the way raw packet sockets (AF_PACKET) used PACKET_COPY_THRESH and mmap operations. A local attacker with CAP_NET_RAW capability could use this flaw to trigger a buffer overflow resulting in a system crash or privilege escalation.(CVE-2022-20368)

A race condition in the Linux kernel before 5.6.2 between the VT_DISALLOCATE ioctl and closing/opening of ttys could lead to a use-after-free.(CVE-2020-36557)

A race condition in the Linux kernel before 5.5.7 involving VT_RESIZEX could lead to a NULL pointer dereference and general protection fault.(CVE-2020-36558)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A type confusion bug in nft_set_elem_init (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can obtain root access, but must start with an unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) This can be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.(CVE-2022-34918)

When setting font with malicous data by ioctl cmd PIO_FONT,kernel will write memory out of bounds.(CVE-2021-33656)

An information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak kernel information.(CVE-2022-0812)

nfqnl_mangle in net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because, in the case of an nf_queue verdict with a one-byte nfta_payload attribute, an skb_pull can encounter a negative skb->len.(CVE-2022-36946)

An integer coercion error was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2022-2639)

A use-after-free flaw was found in route4_change in the net/sched/cls_route.c filter implementation in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system and possibly lead to a local privilege escalation problem.(CVE-2022-2588)
