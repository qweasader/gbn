  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well.(CVE-2021-20322)

In the nl80211_policy policy of nl80211.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not required for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-119770583(CVE-2020-27068)

A race problem was seen in the vt_k_ioctl in drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel, which may cause an out of bounds read in vt as the write access to vc_mode is not protected by lock-in vt_ioctl (KDSETMDE). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2021-3753)

A flaw was found on the Linux kernel. On the PowerPC platform, the KVM guest allows the OS users to cause host OS memory corruption via rtas_args.nargs. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-37576)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-40490)

The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access.(CVE-2021-42008)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's CAPI over Bluetooth connection code. An attacker with a local account can escalate privileges when CAPI (ISDN) hardware connection fails.(CVE-2021-34981)

A flaw out of bounds memory access in the Linux kernel bluetooth subsystem was found in the way when some data being read about the bluetooth device with the hci_extended_inquiry_result_evt call. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or read some data out of memory bounds that can lead to data confidentiality threat.(CVE-2020-36386)

The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt mishandles bounds checking.(CVE-2021-42739)

A denial of service flaw was found in fuse_do_getattr in fs/fuse/dir.c in the kernel side of the FUSE filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2020-36322)");
