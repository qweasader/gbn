  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In ImageMagick, there is an outside the range of representable values of type 'unsigned int' at MagickCore/quantum-private.h. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.(CVE-2020-27768)

A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/visual-effects.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-20244)

In the CropImage() and CropImageToTiles() routines of MagickCore/transform.c, rounding calculations performed on unconstrained pixel offsets was causing undefined behavior in the form of integer overflow and out-of-range values as reported by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Such issues could cause a negative impact to application availability or other problems related to undefined behavior, in cases where ImageMagick processes untrusted input data. The upstream patch introduces functionality to constrain the pixel offsets and prevent these issues. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.(CVE-2020-25675)

A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/bmp.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned int`. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.(CVE-2020-27772)

ImageMagick 7.0.7-26 Q16 has excessive iteration in the DecodeLabImage and EncodeLabImage functions (coders/tiff.c), which results in a hang (tens of minutes) with a tiny PoC file. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted tiff file.(CVE-2018-9133)

In ParseMetaGeometry() of MagickCore/geometry.c, image height and width calculations can lead to divide-by-zero conditions which also lead to undefined behavior. This flaw can be triggered by a crafted input file processed by ImageMagick and could impact application availability. The patch uses multiplication in addition to the function `PerceptibleReciprocal()` in order to prevent such divide-by-zero conditions. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.(CVE-2020-27756)

TIFFGetProfiles() in /coders/tiff.c calls strstr() which causes a large out-of-bounds read when it searches for `'dc:format=\'image/dng\'` within `profile` due to improper string handling, when a crafted input file is provided to ImageMagick. The patch uses a StringInfo type instead of a raw C string to remedy this. This could cause an impact to availability of the application. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.(CVE-2020-25667)

The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
