  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel, where a use-after-frees in nouveau's postclose() handler could happen if removing device (that is not common to remove video card physically without power-off, but same happens if 'unbind' the driver).(CVE-2020-27820)

A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2.(CVE-2022-0617)

An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file descriptor.(CVE-2022-24448)

A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.(CVE-2022-0435)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1.(CVE-2022-0487)

A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's EBPF verifier when handling internal data structures. Internal memory locations could be returned to userspace. A local attacker with the permissions to insert eBPF code to the kernel can use this to leak internal kernel memory details defeating some of the exploit mitigations in place for the kernel.(CVE-2021-4159)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vmw_execbuf_copy_fence_user function in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_execbuf.c in vmwgfx. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a privilege escalation problem.(CVE-2022-22942)

A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses.(CVE-2021-3772)");
