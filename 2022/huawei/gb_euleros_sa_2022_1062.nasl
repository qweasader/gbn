  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.(CVE-2021-22898)

curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to wrong session due to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST when libcurl is built to use the Schannel TLS library. The selected cipher set was stored in a single 'static' variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.(CVE-2021-22897)

curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an 'Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor' by leaking credentials in the HTTP Referer: header. libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the Referer: HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.(CVE-2021-22876)

A flaw was found in libcurl in the way libcurl handles previously used connections without accounting for 'issuer cert' and comparing the involved paths case-insensitively. This flaw allows libcurl to use the wrong connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.(CVE-2021-22924)

A has been found in curl. The fix for CVE-2021-22898 doesn't remedy the vulnerability. A flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables libcurl can pass uninitialized data from a stack-based buffer to the server. This issue leads to potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.(CVE-2021-22925)

A flaw was found in curl in the way curl handles a file hash mismatch after downloading content using the Metalink feature. This flaw allows malicious actors controlling a hosting server to trick users into downloading malicious content. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.(CVE-2021-22922)

A flaw was found in curl in the way curl handles credentials when downloading content using the Metalink feature. This flaw allows malicious actors controlling a hosting server to gain access to credentials provided while downloading content without the user's knowledge. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.(CVE-2021-22923)");
