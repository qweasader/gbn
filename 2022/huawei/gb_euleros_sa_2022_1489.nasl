There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing.(CVE-2021-28714)

A use-after-free read flaw was found in sock_getsockopt() in net/core/sock.c due to SO_PEERCRED and SO_PEERGROUPS race with listen() (and connect()) in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, an attacker with a user privileges may crash the system or leak internal kernel information.(CVE-2021-4203)

A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.(CVE-2021-4155)

Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events [This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs, the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as 'driver domains'. Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
