We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755(CVE-2021-22600)

A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's EBPF verifier when handling internal data structures. Internal memory locations could be returned to userspace. A local attacker with the permissions to insert eBPF code to the kernel can use this to leak internal kernel memory details defeating some of the exploit mitigations in place for the kernel.(CVE-2021-4159)

A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2022-0330)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vmw_execbuf_copy_fence_user function in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_execbuf.c in vmwgfx. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a privilege escalation problem.(CVE-2022-22942)

Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events [This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs, the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as 'driver domains'. Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch 3, CVE-2021-28713(CVE-2021-28711)

A flaw was found in the sctp_make_strreset_req function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the SCTP network protocol in the Linux kernel with a local user privilege access. In this flaw, an attempt to use more buffer than is allocated triggers a BUG_ON issue, leading to a denial of service (DOS).(CVE-2022-0322)

An Out-of-Bounds Read was discovered in arch/arm/mach-footbridge/personal-pci.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.11 because of the lack of a check for a value that shouldn't be negative, e.g., access to element -2 of an array, aka CID-298a58e165e4.(CVE-2021-32078)

A use-after-free read flaw was found in sock_getsockopt() in net/core/sock.c due to SO_PEERCRED and SO_PEERGROUPS race with listen() (and connect()) in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, an attacker with a user privileges may crash the system or leak internal kernel information.(CVE-2021-4203)
