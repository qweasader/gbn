Samba AD DC did not do suffienct access and conformance checking of data stored. At a number of points in the Samba AD DC per-attribute and schema based permission checks were not correctly implemented, allowing up to total domain compromise.(CVE-2020-25722)

Kerberos acceptors need easy access to stable AD identifiers (eg objectSid). Samba as an AD DC now provides a way for Linux applications to obtain a reliable SID (and samAccountName) in issued tickets.(CVE-2020-25721)

A flaw was found in the way Samba, as an Active Directory Domain Controller, implemented Kerberos name-based authentication. The Samba AD DC, could become confused about the user a ticket represents if it did not strictly require a Kerberos PAC and always use the SIDs found within. The result could include total domain compromise.(CVE-2020-25719)

A flaw was found in the way samba implemented SMB1 authentication. An attacker could use this flaw to retrieve the plaintext password sent over the wire even if Kerberos authentication was required.(CVE-2016-2124)

Samba AD DC did not correctly sandbox Kerberos tickets issued by an RODC.The Samba AD DC, when joined by an RODC, did not confirm if the RODC was allowed to print a ticket for that user.(CVE-2020-25718)

Use after free in Samba AD DC RPC server. The AD DC RPC server can use memory that was free()ed when a sub-connection is closed.(CVE-2021-3738)

A null pointer de-reference was found in the way samba kerberos server handled missing sname in TGS-REQ (Ticket Granting Server - Request). An authenticated user could use this flaw to crash the samba server.(CVE-2021-3671)");
