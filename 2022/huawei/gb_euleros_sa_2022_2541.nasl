Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4968.(CVE-2022-1733)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vim's vim_regexec_string() function in regexp.c file. The issue occurs when the function tries to match the buffer with an invalid pattern. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a NULL pointer dereference that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service.(CVE-2022-1674)

A flaw was found in vim, where it is vulnerable to a buffer over-read in the find_next_quote function. This flaw allows a specially crafted file to crash software, modify memory and possibly perform remote execution when opened in vim.(CVE-2022-1629)

A flaw was found in vim, where it is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the vim_strncpy find_word function. This flaw allows a specially crafted file to crash software, modify memory and possibly perform remote execution when opened in vim.(CVE-2022-1621)

A flaw was found in vim, which is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in vim_regexec_string() of the regexp.c function. This flaw allows a specially crafted file to crash software when opened in vim.(CVE-2022-1620)

A flaw was found in vim, which is vulnerable to a heap-buffer-overflow in append_command of the src/ex_docmd.c function. This flaw allows a specially crafted file to crash software, modify memory, or execute code when opened in vim.(CVE-2022-1616)
