A insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability in fixed in curl 7.83.0 might leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number.(CVE-2022-27776)

An improper authentication vulnerability exists in curl 7.33.0 to and including 7.82.0 which might allow reuse OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly making sure that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials as set for this transfer. This affects SASL-enabled protocols: SMPTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (openldap only).(CVE-2022-22576)

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl 7.65.0 to 7.82.0 are vulnerable that by using an IPv6 address that was in the connection pool but with a different zone id it could reuse a connection instead.(CVE-2022-27775)

When curl < 7.84.0 does FTP transfers secured by krb5, it handles message verification failures wrongly. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-In-The-Middle attack to go unnoticed and even allows it to inject data to the client.(CVE-2022-32208)

curl < 7.84.0 supports 'chained' HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a serverresponse can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable 'links' in this 'decompression chain' was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps.The use of such a decompression chain could result in a 'malloc bomb', makingcurl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying toand returning out of memory errors.(CVE-2022-32206)

When curl < 7.84.0 saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the operation with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name.In that rename operation, it might accidentally *widen* the permissions for the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to more users than intended.(CVE-2022-32207)

libcurl provides the `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` option to allow applications torequest details to be returned about a server's certificate chain.Due to an erroneous function, a malicious server could make libcurl built withNSS get stuck in a never-ending busy-loop when trying to retrieve thatinformation.(CVE-2022-27781)

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSHrelated option had been changed that should have prohibited reuse.libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequenttransfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, several TLS andSSH settings were ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
