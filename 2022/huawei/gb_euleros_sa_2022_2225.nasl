  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An issue was discovered in the Linux Kernel from 4.18 to 4.19, an improper update of sock reference in TCP pacing can lead to memory/netns leak, which can be used by remote clients.(CVE-2022-1678)

In ip_check_mc_rcu of igmp.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege when opening and closing inet sockets with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-20141)

Due to the small table perturb size, a memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TCP source port generation algorithm in the net/ipv4/tcp.c function. This flaw allows an attacker to leak information and may cause a denial of service.(CVE-2022-1012)

net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able to create user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to a use-after-free.(CVE-2022-32250)

The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are used.(CVE-2022-32296)

Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18, version 4.14 and later versions.(CVE-2022-29581)

In lg_probe and related functions of hid-lg.c and other USB HID files, there is a possible out of bounds read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local information disclosure if a malicious USB HID device were plugged in, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-20132)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's performance events functionality. A user triggers a race condition in setting up performance monitoring between the leading PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT and sub PERF_EVENT_HARDWARE plus the PERF_EVENT_SOFTWARE using the perf_event_open() function with these three types. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.(CVE-2022-1729)

In mmc_blk_read_single of block.c, there is a possible way to read kernel heap memory due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure if reading from an SD card that triggers errors, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-20008)

The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag.(CVE-2022-30594)");
