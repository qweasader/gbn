Kernel-headers includes the C header files that specify the interfacebetween the Linux kernel and userspace libraries and programs. Theheader files define structures and constants that are needed forbuilding most standard programs and are also needed for rebuilding theglibc package.(CVE-2022-1729)

The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag.(CVE-2022-30594)

Insufficient control flow management for the Intel(R) 82599 Ethernet Controllers and Adapters may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.(CVE-2021-33061)

In mmc_blk_read_single of block.c, there is a possible way to read kernel heap memory due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure if reading from an SD card that triggers errors, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2022-20008)

The root cause of this vulnerability is that the ioctl$DRM_IOCTL_MODE_DESTROY_DUMB can decrease refcount of *drm_vgem_gem_object *(created in *vgem_gem_dumb_create*) concurrently, and *vgem_gem_dumb_create *will access the freed drm_vgem_gem_object.(CVE-2022-1419)

A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.(CVE-2022-1353)

An issue was discovered in the Linux Kernel from 4.18 to 4.19, an improper update of sock reference in TCP pacing can lead to memory/netns leak, which can be used by remote clients.(CVE-2022-1678)

An information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c function in RPCRDMA_HDRLEN_MIN (7) (in rpcrdma_max_call_header_size, rpcrdma_max_reply_header_size). This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak kernel information.(CVE-2022-0812)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle 'return' with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker.(CVE-2022-1016)

Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.(CVE-2022-0002)
