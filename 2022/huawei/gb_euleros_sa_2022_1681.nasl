A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses.(CVE-2021-3772)

A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11. This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory object.(CVE-2021-44733)

In gre_handle_offloads of ip_gre.c, there is a possible page fault due to an invalid memory access. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-150694665References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2021-39633)

User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-204450605References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2021-39634)

A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel s hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data.(CVE-2021-4002)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.8.9. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used.(CVE-2020-26147)

An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate selected fragments. This vulnerability is exploitable when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. Note that WEP is vulnerable to this attack by design.(CVE-2020-26146)

An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.(CVE-2020-26145)

An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames as long as the first 8 bytes correspond to a valid RFC1042 (i.e., LLC/SNAP) header for EAPOL. An adversary can abuse ...
