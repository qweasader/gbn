  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt mishandles bounds checking.(CVE-2021-42739)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A memory leak in the ccp-ops crypto driver can allow attackers to cause a denial of service. This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3744)

prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write.(CVE-2021-41864)

arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context. This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.(CVE-2021-38300)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to conf(CVE-2021-3752)

A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is similar to the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3764)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.2.13. nbd_genl_status in drivers/block/nbd.c does not check the nla_nest_start_noflag return value.(CVE-2019-16089)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Measuring usage of the shared memory does not scale with large shared memory segment counts which could lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.(CVE-2021-3669)

In unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c, there is a possible use after free bug due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2021-0920)

Use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel exploitable by a local attacker due to reuse of a DCCP socket with an attached dccps_hc_tx_ccid object as a listener after being released.(CVE-2020-16119)

A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly ...
