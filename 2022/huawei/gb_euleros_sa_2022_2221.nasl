  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A use-after-free vulnerability was found on grub2's chainloader command. This flaw allows an attacker to gain access to restricted data or cause arbitrary code execution if they can establish control from grub's memory allocation pattern.(CVE-2022-28736)

A flaw was found in grub2 when handling split HTTP headers. While processing a split HTTP header, grub2 wrongly advances its control pointer to the internal buffer by one position, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write. This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this issue by crafting a malicious set of HTTP packages making grub2 corrupt its internal memory metadata structure. This leads to data integrity and confidentiality issues or forces grub to crash, resulting in a denial of service attack.(CVE-2022-28734)

A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user-controlled data to be written in heap. To a successful to be performed the attacker needs to perform some triage over the heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention. This flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.(CVE-2021-3697)

A flaw was found in grub2 when handling a PNG image header. When decoding the data contained in the Huffman table at the PNG file header, an out-of-bounds write may happen on grub's heap.(CVE-2021-3696)

A flaw was found in grub 2, where a crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to an out-of-bounds write. This flaw allows an attacker to corrupt the data on the heap portion of the grub2's memory, leading to possible code execution and the circumvention of the secure boot mechanism.(CVE-2021-3695)

A flaw was found in grub2 when handling IPv4 packets. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious packet, triggering an integer underflow in grub code. Consequently, the memory allocation for handling the packet data may be smaller than the size needed. This issue causes an out-of-bands write during packet handling, compromising data integrity, confidentiality issues, a denial of service, and remote code execution.(CVE-2022-28733)");
