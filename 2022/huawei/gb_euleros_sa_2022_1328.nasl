  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A vulnerability was found in unix_dgram_recvmsg in net/unix/af_unix.c in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket file handlers. In this flaw, a missing cleanup may lead to a use-after-free due to a race problem. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2021-0920)

A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the 'int_ctl' field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.(CVE-2021-3653)

A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel s hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data.(CVE-2021-4002)

A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2021-20321)

In the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3, net/ipv6/output_core.c has an information leak because of certain use of a hash table which, although big, doesn't properly consider that IPv6-based attackers can typically choose among many IPv6 source addresses.(CVE-2021-45485)

In the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.12.4, net/ipv4/route.c has an information leak because the hash table is very small.(CVE-2021-45486)

A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4.(CVE-2021-4083)");
