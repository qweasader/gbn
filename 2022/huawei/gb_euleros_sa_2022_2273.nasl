  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function.(CVE-2022-33981)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's performance events functionality. A user triggers a race condition in setting up performance monitoring between the leading PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT and sub PERF_EVENT_HARDWARE plus the PERF_EVENT_SOFTWARE using the perf_event_open() function with these three types. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.(CVE-2022-1729)

In various methods of kernel base drivers, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a heap buffer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-182388481References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2022-20166)

In lg_probe and related functions of hid-lg.c and other USB HID files, there is a possible out of bounds read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local information disclosure if a malicious USB HID device were plugged in, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-188677105References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2022-20132)

In do_ipt_get_ctl and do_ipt_set_ctl of ip_tables.c, there is a possible way to leak kernel information due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure with system execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-120612905References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2021-39636)

A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.(CVE-2022-0854)

Linux Kernel could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a concurrency use-after-free flaw in the bad_flp_intr function. By executing a specially-crafted program, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on the system.(CVE-2022-1652)

A denial of service flaw was found in the Linux kernel due to insufficient control flow management for the Intel(R) 82599 Ethernet Controllers and Adapters. This flaw allows a locally authenticated user to potentially cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-33061)
