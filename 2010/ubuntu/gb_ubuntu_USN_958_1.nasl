with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-1205)

Yosuke Hasegawa discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could

were tricked into viewing malicious content, an attacker could exploit this
to read data from other domains. (CVE-2010-1213)

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly process improper
CSS selectors. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, an
attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains.
