Original advisory details:

 If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a
 user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could
 cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected
 Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-1121)

 Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a
 user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could
 cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-1200, CVE-2010-1201,
 CVE-2010-1202, CVE-2010-1203)

 A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker
 could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a
 second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
 invoking the program. (CVE-2010-1198)

 An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into
 viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a
 denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
 the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-1196)

 Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting
 routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a
 denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
 the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-1199)

 Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be
 subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote
 attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. (CVE-2010-1125)

 Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'
 HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.
 Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site
 scripting attacks. (CVE-2010-1197)

 Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator
 often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users
 across different web sites. (CVE-2008-5913)");
