Original advisory details:

 Several dangling pointer vulnerabilities were discovered in Firefox. An
 attacker could exploit this to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary
 code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-2760, CVE-2010-2767,
 CVE-2010-3167)

 Blake Kaplan and Michal Zalewski discovered several weaknesses in the
 XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) security wrapper. If a user were tricked into
 viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to run arbitrary
 JavaScript with chrome privileges. (CVE-2010-2762)

 Matt Haggard discovered that Firefox did not honor same-origin policy when
 processing the statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object. If a user
 were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use
 this to gather information about servers on internal private networks.
 (CVE-2010-2764)

 Chris Rohlf discovered an integer overflow when Firefox processed the HTML
 frameset element. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a
 remote attacker could use this to crash the browser or possibly run
 arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-2765)

 Several issues were discovered in the browser engine. If a user were
 tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to
 crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the
 program. (CVE-2010-2766, CVE-2010-3168)

 David Huang and Collin Jackson discovered that the <object> tag could
 override the charset of a framed HTML document in another origin. An
 attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks.
 (CVE-2010-2768)

 Paul Stone discovered that with designMode enabled an HTML selection
 containing JavaScript could be copied and pasted into a document and have
 the JavaScript execute within the context of the site where the code was
 dropped. An attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting
 attacks. (CVE-2010-2769)

 A buffer overflow was discovered in Firefox when processing text runs. If a
 user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could
 use this to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user
 invoking the program. (CVE-2010-3166)

 Peter Van der Beken, Jason Oster, Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Jeff
 Walden, Gary Kwong and Olli Pettay discovered several flaws in the
 browser engine. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a
 remote attacker could use this to crash the browser or possibly run
 arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2010-3169)");
