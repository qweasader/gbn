CVE-2010-0174

Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0175

It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the XUL event handler might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0176

It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the XUL event handler might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0177

It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the plugin code might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0178

Paul Stone discovered that forced drag-and-drop events could lead to Chrome privilege escalation.

CVE-2010-0179

It was discovered that a programming error in the XMLHttpRequestSpy module could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 1.9.0.19-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.");
