CVE-2010-1782
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service.

CVE-2010-1784
The counters functionality in the CSS implementation in WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1
on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before 4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1785
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, accesses uninitialized memory during processing of the (1)
:first-letter and (2) :first-line pseudo-elements in an SVG text element, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1786
Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through
10.6 and Windows, and before 4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via a foreignObject element in an SVG document.

CVE-2010-1787
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service.

CVE-2010-1788
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service.

CVE-2010-1790
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, does not properly handle just-in-time (JIT) compiled JavaScript
stubs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
via a crafted HTML document, related to a 'reentrancy issue.'

CVE-2010-1792
WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before
4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service.

CVE-2010-1793
Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.1 on Mac OS X
10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before 4.1.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via a (1) font-face or (2) use element
in an SVG document.

CVE-2010-2648
The implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm in Google Chrome before 5.0.375.99
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact
via unknown vectors.");
