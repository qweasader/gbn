CVE-2024-2611, CVE-2024-2614, CVE-2024-2615)

Hubert Kario discovered that Firefox had a timing side-channel when
performing RSA decryption. A remote attacker could possibly use this
issue to recover sensitive information. (CVE-2023-5388)

It was discovered that Firefox did not properly handle WASM register
values in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this
issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-2606)

Gary Kwong discovered that Firefox incorrectly updated return registers
for JIT code on Armv7-A systems. An attacker could potentially exploit
this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-2607)

Ronald Crane discovered that Firefox did not properly manage memory during
character encoding. An attacker could potentially exploit this issue to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-2608)

Georg Felber and Marco Squarcina discovered that Firefox incorrectly
handled html and body tags. An attacker who was able to inject markup into
a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able
obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2024-2610)

Ronald Crane discovered a use-after-free in Firefox when handling code in
SafeRefPtr. An attacker could potentially exploit this issue to cause a
denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-2612)

Max Inden discovered that Firefox incorrectly handled QUIC ACK frame
decoding. A attacker could potentially exploit this issue to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2024-2613)");
