It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly manage certain memory
operations when processing graphics shared memory. An attacker could
potentially exploit this issue to escape the sandbox. (CVE-2024-7519)

Irvan Kurniawan discovered that Thunderbird did not properly check an
attribute value in the editor component, leading to an out-of-bounds read
vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial
of service or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-7522)

Rob Wu discovered that Thunderbird did not properly check permissions when
creating a StreamFilter. An attacker could possibly use this issue to
modify response body of requests on any site using a web extension.
(CVE-2024-7525)

Nils Bars discovered that Thunderbird contained a type confusion
vulnerability when performing certain property name lookups. An attacker
could potentially exploit this issue to cause a denial of service, or
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-8381)

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly manage memory during
garbage collection. An attacker could potentially exploit this issue to
cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-8384)");
