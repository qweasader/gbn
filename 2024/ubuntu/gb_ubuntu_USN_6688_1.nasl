  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Pratyush Yadav discovered that the Xen network backend implementation in
the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero length data request, leading
to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM
could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).
(CVE-2023-46838)

It was discovered that the Habana's AI Processors driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize certain data structures before passing
them to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive
information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-50431)

Murray McAllister discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle memory objects when storing surfaces,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker in a guest VM
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5633)

It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate certain SMB messages, leading to an
out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2023-6610)

It was discovered that the VirtIO subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use
this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2024-0340)

Lonial Con discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle element deactivation in certain cases, leading to a
use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2024-1085)

Notselwyn discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle verdict parameters in certain cases, leading to a use-
after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2024-1086)

Chenyuan Yang discovered that the RDS Protocol implementation in the Linux
kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use
this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-23849)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem
in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A
privileged local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2024-24860)

Several security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel.
An attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system.
This update corrects flaws in the following subsystems:
 - Architecture specifics,
 - Block layer,
 - ACPI drivers,
 - Android drivers,
 - EDAC drivers,
 - GPU drivers,
 - InfiniBand drivers,
 - Media drivers,
 - Multifunction device drivers,
 - ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
