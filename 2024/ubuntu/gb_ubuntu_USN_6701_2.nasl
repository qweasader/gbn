  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Ruihan Li discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly perform permissions checks when handling HCI sockets. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(bluetooth communication). (CVE-2023-2002)

It was discovered that the NVIDIA Tegra XUSB pad controller driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle return values in certain error
conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2023-23000)

It was discovered that Spectre-BHB mitigations were missing for Ampere
processors. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2023-3006)

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle block device modification while it is
mounted. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-34256)

Eric Dumazet discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly handle DCCP conntrack buffers in certain situations,
leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could possibly
use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39197)

It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in
certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically
proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2023-4132)

Pratyush Yadav discovered that the Xen network backend implementation in
the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero length data request, leading
to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM
could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).
(CVE-2023-46838)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking
subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)

Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem of the Linux kernel
did not properly handle connect command payloads in certain situations,
leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use
this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-6121)

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle the remount operation in certain cases,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2024-0775)
