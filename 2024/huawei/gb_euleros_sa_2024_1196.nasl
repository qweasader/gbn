  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.A perf_event's read_size can overflow, leading to an heap out-of-bounds increment or write in perf_read_group().We recommend upgrading past commit 382c27f4ed28f803b1f1473ac2d8db0afc795a1b.(CVE-2023-6931)

A race condition was found in the GSM 0710 tty multiplexor in the Linux kernel. This issue occurs when two threads execute the GSMIOC_SETCONF ioctl on the same tty file descriptor with the gsm line discipline enabled, and can lead to a use-after-free problem on a struct gsm_dlci while restarting the gsm mux. This could allow a local unprivileged user to escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-6546)

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ipv4: igmp component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.A race condition can be exploited to cause a timer be mistakenly registered on a RCU read locked object which is freed by another thread.We recommend upgrading past commit e2b706c691905fe78468c361aaabc719d0a496f1.(CVE-2023-6932)

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in smbCalcSize in fs/smb/client/netmisc.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information.(CVE-2023-6606)

A race condition was found in the QXL driver in the Linux kernel. The qxl_mode_dumb_create() function dereferences the qobj returned by the qxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one holding a reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returned handle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation.(CVE-2023-39198)

Closing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a deadlock. This happens when the close is being performed in parallel to an unrelated Xen console action and the handling of a Xen console interrupt in an unprivileged guest. The closing of an event channel is e.g. triggered by removal of a paravirtual device on the other side. As this action will cause console messages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance of triggering the deadlock is not neglectable. Note that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit Linux kernel on Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger the issue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers to get the lock).(CVE-2023-34324)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.c` in `nvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a logical bug in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a malicious local privileged user to cause a use-after-free and double-free problem, which may permit remote code execution or lead to local privilege escalation problem.(CVE-2023-5178)
