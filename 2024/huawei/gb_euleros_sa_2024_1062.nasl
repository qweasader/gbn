  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A race condition was found in the QXL driver in the Linux kernel. The qxl_mode_dumb_create() function dereferences the qobj returned by the qxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one holding a reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returned handle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation.(CVE-2023-39198)

A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.If perf_read_group() is called while an event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.We recommend upgrading past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06.(CVE-2023-5717)

A flaw was found in the XFRM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The specific flaw exists within the processing of state filters, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to an information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39194)

A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The sctp_mt_check did not validate the flag_count field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39193)

An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/storage/ene_ub6250.c for the ENE UB6250 reader driver in the Linux kernel before 6.2.5. An object could potentially extend beyond the end of an allocation.(CVE-2023-45862)

An issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.(CVE-2023-45871)

A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The xt_u32 module did not validate the fields in the xt_u32 structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the array boundaries, leading to a crash or information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39192)

A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The nfnl_osf_add_callback function did not validate the user mode controlled opt_num field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure.(CVE-2023-39189)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel ipv4 stack. The socket buffer (skb) was assumed to be associated with a device before calling __ip_options_compile, which is not always the case if the skb is re-routed by ipvs. This issue may allow a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to crash the system.(CVE-2023-42754)
