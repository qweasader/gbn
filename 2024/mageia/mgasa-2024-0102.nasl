  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions
3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl`
are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate
validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of
Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a
specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This
attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. (CVE-2023-46724)
Due to a Buffer Overread bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack against Squid HTTP Message processing. (CVE-2023-49285)
Due to an Incorrect Check of Function Return Value bug Squid is
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against its Helper process
management. (CVE-2023-49286)
Due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug in versions 2.6 through
2.7.STABLE9, versions 3.1 through 5.9, and versions 6.0.1 through 6.5,
Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP
Request parsing. This problem allows a remote client to perform Denial
of Service attack by sending a large X-Forwarded-For header when the
follow_x_forwarded_for feature is configured. (CVE-2023-50269)
Due to an expired pointer reference bug, Squid prior to version 6.6 is
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Cache Manager error
responses. This problem allows a trusted client to perform Denial of
Service when generating error pages for Client Manager reports.
(CVE-2024-23638)
 Starting in version 3.5.27 and prior to version 6.8, Squid may be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Chunked decoder
due to an uncontrolled recursion bug. This problem allows a remote
attacker to cause Denial of Service when sending a crafted, chunked,
encoded HTTP Message. (CVE-2024-25111)
Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,Squid may be vulnerable
to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP header parsing. This problem
allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial of Service
when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions of Squid
prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or
reply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default.
