     lxc was updated to 6.0.2:

       The LXC team is pleased to announce the release of LXC 6.0.2! This is
     the second bugfix release for LXC 6.0 which is supported until June 2029.

       As usual this bugfix releases focus on stability and hardening.

  * Some of the highlights for this release are:

  - Reduced log level on some common messages

  - Fix compilation error on aarch64

  * Detailed changelog

  - Remove unused function

  - idmap: Lower logging level of newXidmap tools to INFO

  - Exit 0 when there's no error

  - doc: Fix definitions of get_config_path and set_config_path

  - README: Update security contact

  - fix possible clang compile error in AARCH

     Update to 6.0.1:

       The LXC team is pleased to announce the release of LXC 6.0.1! This is
     the first bugfix release for LXC 6.0 which is supported until June 2029.

       As usual this bugfix releases focus on stability and hardening.

  * Highlights

  - Fixed some build tooling issues

  - Fixed startup failures on system without IPv6 support

  - Updated AppArmor rules to avoid potential warnings

     Update to 6.0.0:

       The LXC team is pleased to announce the release of LXC 6.0 LTS! This is
     the result of two years of work since the LXC 5.0 release and is the sixth
     LTS release for the LXC project. This release will be supported until June
     2029.

  * New multi-call binary¶

         A new tools-multicall=true configuration option can be used to produce
     a single lxc binary which can then have all other lxc-XYZ commands be
     symlinked to. This allows for a massive disk space reduction, particularly
     useful for embedded platforms.

  * Add a set_timeout function to the library

         A new set_timeout function is available on the main lxc_container
     struct and allow for setting a global timeout for interactions with the
     LXC monitor. Prior to this, there was no timeout, leading to potential
     deadlocks as there's also no way to cancel an monitor request. As a result
     of adding this new symbol to the library, we have bumped the liblxc symbol
     version to 1.8.0.

  * LXC bridge now has IPV6 enabled

         The default lxcbr0 bridge now comes with IPv6 enabled by default,
     using an IPv6 ULA subnet. Support for uid/gid selection in lxc-usernsexec
     The lxc-usernsexec tool now has both -u and -g options to control what
     resulting UID and GID (respectively) the user wishes to use ...
