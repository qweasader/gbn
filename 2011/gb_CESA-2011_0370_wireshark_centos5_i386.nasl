  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Wireshark. If Wireshark
  opened a specially-crafted capture file, it could crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2011-0024)

  Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
  crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
  opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2010-3445, CVE-2011-0538, CVE-2011-1139,
  CVE-2011-1140, CVE-2011-1141, CVE-2011-1143)
