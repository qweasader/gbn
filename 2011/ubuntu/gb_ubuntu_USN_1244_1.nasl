Andrea Righi discovered a race condition in the KSM memory merging support.
If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2183)

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly
handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-2491)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID
lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-2517)

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration
files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into
running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an
attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Comedi driver did not correctly clear
memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory,
leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2909)

Yogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that had
no prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could
exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
