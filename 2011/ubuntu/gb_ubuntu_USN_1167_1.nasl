handling of IPv4 icmp packets. A remote user could exploit this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1927)

Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly
clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could
exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of
privacy. (CVE-2011-0463)

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not
correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk
device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1017)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly clear
memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory,
leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1078)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly check
that device name strings were NULL terminated. A local attacker could
exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or leak
contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
(CVE-2011-1079)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that bridge network filtering did not check that
name fields were NULL terminated. A local attacker could exploit this to
leak contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
(CVE-2011-1080)

Johan Hovold discovered that the DCCP network stack did not correctly
handle certain packet combinations. A remote attacker could send specially
crafted network traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-1093)

Peter Huewe discovered that the TPM device did not correctly initialize
memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel heap memory
contents, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1160)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the netfilter code did not check certain
strings copied from userspace. A local attacker with netfilter access could
exploit this to read kernel memory or crash the system, leading to a denial
of service. (CVE-2011-1170, CVE-2011-1171, CVE-2011-1172, CVE-2011-2534)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Acorn Universal Networking driver did
not correctly initialize memory. A remote attacker could send specially
crafted traffic to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
(CVE-2011-1173)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IRDA subsystem did not correctly check
certain field sizes. If a system was using IRDA, a remote attacker could
send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1180)

Dan Rosenberg reported errors in the OSS (Open Sound System) MIDI
interface. A local attacker on non-x86 systems might be able to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1476)

Dan Rosenberg reported errors in the kernel's OSS (Open Sound System)
driver for Yamaha FM synthesizer chips. A local user can exploit ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
