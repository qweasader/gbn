certain iovec buffers. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. (CVE-2010-3865)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel X.25 implementation did
not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to
read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3875)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel sockets implementation did
not properly initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit
this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
(CVE-2010-3876)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the TIPC interface did not correctly
initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read
kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3877)

Nelson Elhage discovered that the Linux kernel IPv4 implementation did not
properly audit certain bytecodes in netlink messages. A local attacker
could exploit this to cause the kernel to hang, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2010-3880)

It was discovered that multithreaded exec did not handle CPU timers
correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4248)

Krishna Gudipati discovered that the bfa adapter driver did not correctly
initialize certain structures. A local attacker could read files in /sys to
crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4343)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the install_special_mapping function could
bypass the mmap_min_addr restriction. A local attacker could exploit this
to mmap 4096 bytes below the mmap_min_addr area, possibly improving the
chances of performing NULL pointer dereference attacks. (CVE-2010-4346)

It was discovered that the ICMP stack did not correctly handle certain
unreachable messages. If a remote attacker were able to acquire a socket
lock, they could send specially crafted traffic that would crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4526)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the OSS subsystem did not handle name
termination correctly. A local attacker could exploit this crash the system
or gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4527)

An error was reported in the kernel's ORiNOCO wireless driver's handling of
TKIP countermeasures. This reduces the amount of time an attacker needs
breach a wireless network using WPA+TKIP for security. (CVE-2010-4648)

Dan Carpenter discovered that the Infiniband driver did not correctly
handle certain requests. A local user could exploit this to crash the
system or potentially gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4649, CVE-2011-1044)

An error was discovered in the kernel's handling of CUSE (Character device
in Userspace). A local attacker might exploit this flaw to escalate
privilege, if access to /dev/cuse has been modified to allow ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
