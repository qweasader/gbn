parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices
could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges.

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled
certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker
could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)

Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not
correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was
available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain
root privileges. (CVE-2011-2700)

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when
Generic Receive Offload (CVE-2011-2723)

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be
filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-2928)

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence
number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict
sequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
