certain iovec buffers. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. (CVE-2010-3865)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Linux kernel X.25 implementation
incorrectly parsed facilities. A remote attacker could exploit this to
crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3873)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the CAN protocol on 64bit systems did not
correctly calculate the size of certain buffers. A local attacker could
exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the
root user. (CVE-2010-3874)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel X.25 implementation did
not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to
read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3875)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel sockets implementation did
not properly initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit
this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the TIPC interface did not correctly
initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read
kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3877)

Nelson Elhage discovered that the Linux kernel IPv4 implementation did not
properly audit certain bytecodes in netlink messages. A local attacker
could exploit this to cause the kernel to hang, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2010-3880)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the RME Hammerfall DSP audio interface driver
did not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this
to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4080,
CVE-2010-4081)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the VIA video driver did not correctly clear
kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack
memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4082)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the semctl syscall did not correctly clear
kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack
memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4083)

James Bottomley discovered that the ICP vortex storage array controller
driver did not validate certain sizes. A local attacker on a 64bit system
could exploit this to crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2010-4157)

Dan Rosenberg discovered multiple flaws in the X.25 facilities parsing. If
a system was using X.25, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4164)

It was discovered that multithreaded exec did not handle CPU timers
correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4248)
