  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Dan Rosenberg discovered that multiple terminal ioctls did not correctly
initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read
portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
(CVE-2010-4076, CVE-2010-4077)

Alex Shi and Eric Dumazet discovered that the network stack did not
correctly handle packet backlogs. A remote attacker could exploit this by
sending a large amount of network traffic to cause the system to run out of
memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4251, CVE-2010-4805)

It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle
permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open
files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges,
potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2011-1020)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly
handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote
attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1493)

Timo Warns discovered that the GUID partition parsing routines did not
correctly validate certain structures. A local attacker with physical
access could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system,
leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1577)

It was discovered that CIFS incorrectly handled authentication. When a user
had a CIFS share mounted that required authentication, a local user could
mount the same share without knowing the correct password. (CVE-2011-1585)

It was discovered that the GRE protocol incorrectly handled netns
initialization. A remote attacker could send a packet while the ip_gre
module was loading, and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1767)

It was discovered that the IP/IP protocol incorrectly handled netns
initialization. A remote attacker could send a packet while the ipip module
was loading, and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1768)

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the kernel's handling of corrupt LDM
partitions. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service or
escalate privileges. (CVE-2011-2182)

Andrea Righi discovered a race condition in the KSM memory merging support.
If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2183)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats listeners were not correctly
handled. A local attacker could exploit this to exhaust memory and CPU
resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2484)

It was discovered that Bluetooth l2cap and rfcomm did not correctly
initialize structures. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
