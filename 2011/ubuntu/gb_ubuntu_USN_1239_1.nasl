  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN
packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted
traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-1576)

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not
correctly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit
this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1833)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access
restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled
certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker
could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)

Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment
identification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust
network resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2699)

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration
files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into
running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an
attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.
(CVE-2011-2905)

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be
filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-2928)

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence
number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict
sequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
(CVE-2011-3191)

Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a flaw in the FUSE kernel module. A local user
who can mount a FUSE file system could cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-3353)

Gideon Naim discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling VLAN 0 frames.
An attacker on the local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2011-3593)");
