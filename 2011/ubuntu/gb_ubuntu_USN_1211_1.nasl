permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open
files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges,
potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2011-1020)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly
handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote
attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1493)

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not
correctly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit
this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1833)

It was discovered that Bluetooth l2cap and rfcomm did not correctly
initialize structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions
of the kernel stack, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2492)

It was discovered that GFS2 did not correctly check block sizes. A local
attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-2689)

Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment
identification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust
network resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2699)

The performance counter subsystem did not correctly handle certain
counters. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading
to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2918)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's /proc/*/*map* interface. A local,
unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2011-3637)

Ben Hutchings discovered several flaws in the Linux Rose (X.25 PLP) layer.
A local user or a remote user on an X.25 network could exploit these flaws
to execute arbitrary code as root. (CVE-2011-4914)");
