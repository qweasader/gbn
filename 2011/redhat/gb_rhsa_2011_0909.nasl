  has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

  A flaw was found in the way large amounts of memory were allocated on
  64-bit systems when using the BigDecimal class. A context-dependent
  attacker could use this flaw to cause memory corruption, causing a Ruby
  application that uses the BigDecimal class to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. This issue did not affect 32-bit systems. (CVE-2011-0188)

  A race condition flaw was found in the remove system entries method in the
  FileUtils module. If a local user ran a Ruby script that uses this method,
  a local attacker could use this flaw to delete arbitrary files and
  directories accessible to that user via a symbolic link attack.
  (CVE-2011-1004)

  It was found that WEBrick (the Ruby HTTP server toolkit) did not filter
  terminal escape sequences from its log files. A remote attacker could use
  specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject terminal escape sequences into
  the WEBrick log files. If a victim viewed the log files with a terminal
  emulator, it could result in control characters being executed with the
  privileges of that user. (CVE-2009-4492)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way WEBrick displayed
  error pages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a cross-site
  scripting attack against victims by tricking them into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL. (CVE-2010-0541)

  A flaw was found in the method for translating an exception message into a
  string in the Exception class. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  bypass safe level 4 restrictions, allowing untrusted (tainted) code to
  modify arbitrary, trusted (untainted) strings, which safe level 4
  restrictions would otherwise prevent. (CVE-2011-1005)

  Red Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of Apple Product Security for
  reporting the CVE-2011-0188 and CVE-2010-0541 issues.

  All Ruby users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.");
