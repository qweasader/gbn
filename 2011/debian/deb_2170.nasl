For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 1:2.1.11-11+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version 1:2.1.13-5.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:2.1.14-1.
