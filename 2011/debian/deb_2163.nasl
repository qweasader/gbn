CVE-2011-0696

For several reasons the internal CSRF protection was not used to validate AJAX requests in the past. However, it was discovered that this exception can be exploited with a combination of browser plugins and redirects and thus is not sufficient.

CVE-2011-0697

It was discovered that the file upload form is prone to cross-site scripting attacks via the file name.

It is important to note that this update introduces minor backward incompatibilities due to the fixes for the above issues. For the exact details, please see: and in particular the Backwards incompatible changes section.
