daemon or other system initialisation system to define modes of system operation.

Eight runlevels are permitted, the first seven are numbered 0-6 and the eighth is named S or s
(both are permitted).

Services and other system components are said to exist in one or more runlevels. When switching from
one runlevel to another, the services that should not exist in the new runlevel are stopped and the
services that only exist in the new runlevel are started.

This is performed by the /etc/init.d/rc script executed on a change of runlevel (by jobs run on the
runlevel event in the Upstart system). This script examines symlinks in the /etc/rc?.d directories,
symlinks beginning K are services to be stopped and symlinks beginning S are services to be started.
