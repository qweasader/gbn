  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
bypass a configured File Policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to
incorrect detection of modified HTTP packets used in chunked responses. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets
through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
to bypass a configured File Policy for HTTP packets and deliver a
malicious payload. (CVE-2020-3299)

Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
bypass the configured file policies on an affected system. The
vulnerability is due to errors in how the Snort detection engine handles
specific HTTP responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending crafted HTTP packets that would flow through an affected system. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured file
policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network.
(CVE-2020-3315)

Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
bypass a configured file policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to
incorrect handling of an HTTP range header. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an affected device.
A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured file
policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload. (CVE-2021-1223)

Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability with TCP Fast Open
(TFO) when used in conjunction with the Snort detection engine that could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file
policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the
HTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the TFO
connection handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected
device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass
configured file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.
(CVE-2021-1224)

Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
application detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to bypass the configured policies on an affected system. The
vulnerability is due to a flaw in the detection algorithm. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets that would
flow through an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious
payload to the protected network. (CVE-2021-1236)
