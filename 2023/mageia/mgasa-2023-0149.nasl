  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This kernel-linus update is based on upstream 5.15.106 and fixes at least the
following security issues:

A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket
UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function.
While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN,
it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that
capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in
filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters
(CVE-2023-1076).

In the Linux kernel, pick_next_rt_entity() may return a type confused entry,
not detected by the BUG_ON condition, as the confused entry will not be
NULL, but list_head.The buggy error condition would lead to a type confused
entry with the list head,which would then be used as a type confused
sched_rt_entity,causing memory corruption (CVE-2023-1077).

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be triggered in
asus_kbd_backlight_set when plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device,
which advertises itself as an Asus device. Similarly to the previous known
CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct may be scheduled by the
LED controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free
on the struct asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may
exploit the issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data
(CVE-2023-1079).

A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/
transceiver driver was found in the way user detaching rc device. A local
user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their
privileges on the system (CVE-2023-1118).

A use-after-free flaw was found in btrfs_search_slot in fs/btrfs/ctree.c
in btrfs in the Linux Kernel.This flaw allows an attacker to crash the
system and possibly cause a kernel information leak (CVE-2023-1611).

A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card)
Ethernet driver was found.A local user could use this flaw to crash the
system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system
(CVE-2023-1670).

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index
filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.
The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in
case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can
later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use
this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root (CVE-2023-1829).

A use-after-free flaw was found in xgene_hwmon_remove in drivers/hwmon/
xgene-hwmon.c in the Hardware Monitoring Linux Kernel Driver (xgene-hwmon).
This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race
problem. This vulnerability could even lead to a kernel information leak
problem (CVE-2023-1855).
