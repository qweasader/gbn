unauthenticated remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform
a timing attack and hijack sessions. (CVE-2019-16782)

It was discovered that Rack was incorrectly handling cookies during
parsing, not validating them or performing the necessary integrity checks.
An attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite existing cookie
data and gain control over a remote system's behaviour. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM. (CVE-2020-8184)

It was discovered that Rack was not properly parsing data when processing
multipart POST requests. If a user or automated system were tricked into
sending a specially crafted multipart POST request to an application using
Rack, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
service. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04
ESM. (CVE-2022-30122)

It was discovered that Rack was not properly escaping untrusted data when
performing logging operations, which could cause shell escaped sequences
to be written to a terminal. If a user or automated system were tricked
into sending a specially crafted request to an application using Rack, a
remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code in
the machine running the application. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu
14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2022-30123)");
