clear microarchitectural state after speculative execution of various
instructions. A local unprivileged user could use this to obtain to
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-40982)

William Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in
certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4269)

It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading
to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use
this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48502)

Seth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform
address randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or
in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2023-0597)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the btrfs file system
implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1611)

It was discovered that the APM X-Gene SoC hardware monitoring driver in the
Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2023-1855)

It was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device
removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1990)

Ruihan Li discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly perform permissions checks when handling HCI sockets. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(bluetooth communication). (CVE-2023-2002)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that some AMD processors did not properly handle
speculative execution of certain vector register instructions. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20593)

It was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain
images. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image
that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2023-2124)

Ye Zhang and Nicolas Wu discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle locking for rings with IOPOLL, leading to a
double-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
