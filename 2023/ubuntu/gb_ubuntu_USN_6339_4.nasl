Zi Fan Tan discovered that the binder IPC implementation in the Linux
kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-21255)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system in
the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An
attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when
mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2023-2898)

It was discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly handle locking events in certain situations. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).
(CVE-2023-31084)

Yang Lan discovered that the GFS2 file system implementation in the Linux
kernel could attempt to dereference a null pointer in some situations. An
attacker could use this to construct a malicious GFS2 image that, when
mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2023-3212)

It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly validate buffer sizes in certain operations, leading to an out-of-
bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2023-38426, CVE-2023-38428)

It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly calculate the size of certain buffers. A remote attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-38429)");
