  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly
check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local
privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2023-31085)

Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39189)

Bien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A
local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4244)

Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle socket buffers (skb) when performing IP routing in
certain circumstances, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2023-42754)

Yikebaer Aizezi discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when handling inode
extent metadata. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4
file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2023-45898)

Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM)
implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly
handle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a
denial of service (host kernel crash). (CVE-2023-5090)

Jason Wang discovered that the virtio ring implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle iov buffers in some situations. A local
attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host
system crash). (CVE-2023-5158)

Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly handle queue initialization failures in certain
situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5178)

It was discovered that the SMB network file sharing protocol implementation
in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2023-5345)

Murray McAllister discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle memory objects when storing surfaces,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker in a guest VM
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
