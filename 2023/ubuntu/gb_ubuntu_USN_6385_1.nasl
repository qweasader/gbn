  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could
speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling
thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2022-27672)

William Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in
certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4269)

Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that syscalls invoking the
do_prlimit() function in the Linux kernel did not properly handle
speculative execution barriers. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0458)

It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a
type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)

It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1076, CVE-2023-4194)

It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a high rate of hash collisions in connection lookup table. A
remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive CPU
consumption). (CVE-2023-1206)

It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some
situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a
malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1380)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the btrfs file system
implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1611)

Ruihan Li discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly perform permissions checks when handling HCI sockets. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(bluetooth communication). (CVE-2023-2002)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that some AMD processors did not properly handle
speculative execution of certain vector register instructions. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20593)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI
TCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)
