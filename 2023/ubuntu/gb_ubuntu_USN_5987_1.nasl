not properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2
VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive
information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2022-2196)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI
GRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-3424)

Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux
kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2022-36280)

Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-
after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-41218)

Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause
a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-4382)

It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading
to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-48423)

It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading
to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use
this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48424)

Jose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall
implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against
indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker
could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)

It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly validate buffer lengths, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2023-0210)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0266)

Kyle Zeng discovered that the class-based queuing discipline implementation
in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some
situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
