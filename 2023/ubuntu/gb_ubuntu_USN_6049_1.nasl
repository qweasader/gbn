It was discovered that Netty created temporary files with excessive
permissions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to expose
sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu
18.04 ESM, and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-21290)

It was discovered that Netty did not properly validate content-length
headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to smuggle
requests. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-21295,
CVE-2021-21409)

It was discovered that Netty's Bzip2 decompression decoder did not limit
the decompressed output data size. A remote attacker could possibly use
this issue to cause Netty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading
to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu

Netty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2021-37137)

It was discovered that Netty did not properly handle control chars at the
beginning and end of header names. A remote attacker could possibly use
this issue to smuggle requests. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM,
Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-43797)

It was discovered that Netty could be made into an infinite recursion when
parsing a malformed crafted message. A remote attacker could possibly use
this issue to cause Netty to crash, leading to a denial of service. This
issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10.

It was discovered that Netty did not validate header values under certain
circumstances. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform
HTTP response splitting via malicious header values. This issue only
