contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.

Tamas Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP handshake implementation
in the Linux kernel contained multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42896)

Mingwei Zhang discovered that the KVM implementation for AMD processors in
the Linux kernel did not properly handle cache coherency with Secure
Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). A local attacker could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2022-0171)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Android Binder IPC
subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20421)

David Leadbeater discovered that the netfilter IRC protocol tracking
implementation in the Linux Kernel incorrectly handled certain message
payloads in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service or bypass firewall filtering. (CVE-2022-2663)

It was discovered that the Intel 740 frame buffer driver in the Linux
kernel contained a divide by zero vulnerability. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3061)

It was discovered that the sound subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a
race condition in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause
a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3303)

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Unix domain socket
implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3543)

Gwnaun Jung discovered that the SFB packet scheduling implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3586)

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HCI implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. An attacker could
possibly use this cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2022-3619)

It was discovered that the hugetlb implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition in some situations. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive
information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-3623)

It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A
