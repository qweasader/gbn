  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a high rate of hash collisions in connection lookup table. A
remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive CPU
consumption). (CVE-2023-1206)

Daniel Trujillo, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi discovered that some AMD
processors utilising speculative execution and branch prediction may allow
unauthorised memory reads via a speculative side-channel attack. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel
memory. (CVE-2023-20569)

It was discovered that the IPv6 RPL protocol implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle user-supplied data. A remote attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2156)

Davide Ornaghi discovered that the DECnet network protocol implementation
in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A
remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. Please note that kernel support for the
DECnet has been removed to resolve this CVE. (CVE-2023-3338)

Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly validate command payload size, leading to a out-of-bounds
read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38432)

It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained
a use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication
in certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information
(kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3863)

Laurence Wit discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly validate a buffer size in certain situations, leading to
an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2023-3865)

Laurence Wit discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability when handling handling
chained requests. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3866)

It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in
certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically
proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2023-4132)

Andy Nguyen discovered that the KVM implementation for AMD processors in
the Linux kernel with Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) contained a
race condition when accessing the GHCB page. A local attacker in a SEV
guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
