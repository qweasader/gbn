  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2
VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive
information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2022-2196)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen network backend
driver in the Linux kernel when handling dropped packets in certain
circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329)

Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause
a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-4382)

Jose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall
implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against
indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker
could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0266)

It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained
a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2023-0469)

It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a user-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker
could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1195)

It was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained
an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access
could plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)");
