in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1281)

It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3669)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI
GRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-3424)

Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux
kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2022-36280)

It was discovered that the infrared transceiver USB driver did not properly
handle USB control messages. A local attacker with physical access could
plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory
exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3903)

Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-
after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-41218)

It was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2022-47929)

Jose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall
implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against
indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker
could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0266)

Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2023-0394)

It was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in
the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some
situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2023-1073)

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (memory ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
