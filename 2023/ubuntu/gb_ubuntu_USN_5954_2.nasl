Original advisory details:

 Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
 potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
 information across domains, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-25750,
 CVE-2023-25752, CVE-2023-28162, CVE-2023-28176, CVE-2023-28177)

 Lukas Bernhard discovered that Firefox did not properly manage memory
 when invalidating JIT code while following an iterator. An attacker could
 potentially exploits this issue to cause a denial of service.
 (CVE-2023-25751)

 Rob Wu discovered that Firefox did not properly manage the URLs when
 following a redirect to a publicly accessible web extension file. An
 attacker could potentially exploits this to obtain sensitive information.
 (CVE-2023-28160)

 Luan Herrera discovered that Firefox did not properly manage cross-origin
 iframe when dragging a URL. An attacker could potentially exploit this
 issue to perform spoofing attacks. (CVE-2023-28164)

 Khiem Tran discovered that Firefox did not properly manage one-time
 permissions granted to a document loaded using a file: URL. An attacker
 could potentially exploit this issue to use granted one-time permissions
 on the local files came from different sources. (CVE-2023-28161)");
