  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that a race condition existed in
the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2023-32233)

Gwangun Jung discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler
implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-31436)

Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86
processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers
in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a
denial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2023-30456)

It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some
situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a
malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1380)

Zheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a
double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)

Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did
not properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions
in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive
information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0459)

It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a
type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability
in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)

Xingyuan Mo discovered that the x86 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly initialize some data structures. A local attacker could
use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1513)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI
TCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)

Jean-Baptiste Cayrou discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu
Linux kernel contained a race condition when handling inode locking in some
situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
