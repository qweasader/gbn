CVE-2016-2224

Fix possible denial of service via a specially crafted DNS reply that could cause an infinite loop.

CVE-2016-2225

Fix possible denial of service via specially crafted packet that will make the parser in libc/inet/resolv.c terminate early.

CVE-2016-6264

It was found that BLT instruction in libc/string/arm/memset.S checks for signed values. If the parameter of memset is negative, then value added to the PC will be large. An attacker that controls the length parameter of memset can also control the value of PC register.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 0.9.32-1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your uclibc packages.
