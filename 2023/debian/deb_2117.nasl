Jeff Trawick discovered a flaw in the apr_brigade_split_line() function in apr-util. A remote attacker could send crafted http requests to cause a greatly increased memory consumption in Apache httpd, resulting in a denial of service.

This upgrade fixes this issue. After the upgrade, any running apache2 server processes need to be restarted.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.12+dfsg-8+lenny5.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.9+dfsg-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your apr-util packages.");
