CVE-2021-3664

url-parse mishandles certain uses of a single (back)slash such as https: and https:/, and interprets the URI as a relative path. Browsers accept a single backslash after the protocol, and treat it as a normal slash, while url-parse sees it as a relative path. Depending on library usage, this may result in allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior.

CVE-2021-27515

Using backslash in the protocol is valid in the browser, while url-parse thinks it's a relative path. An application that validates a URL using url-parse might pass a malicious link.

CVE-2022-0512

Incorrect handling of username and password can lead to failure to properly identify the hostname, which in turn could result in authorization bypass.

CVE-2022-0639

Incorrect conversion of @ characters in protocol in the href field can lead to lead to failure to properly identify the hostname, which in turn could result in authorization bypass.

CVE-2022-0686

Rohan Sharma reported that url-parse is unable to find the correct hostname when no port number is provided in the URL, such as in [link moved to references]:. This could in turn result in SSRF attacks, open redirects or any other vulnerability which depends on the hostname field of the parsed URL.

CVE-2022-0691

url-parse is unable to find the correct hostname when the URL contains a backspace b character. This tricks the parser into interpreting the URL as a relative path, bypassing all hostname checks. It can also lead to false positive in extractProtocol().

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version 1.2.0-2+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your node-url-parse packages.

For the detailed security status of node-url-parse please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
