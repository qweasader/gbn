The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-2948

When processing a crafted Route Refresh message received from a configured, authenticated BGP neighbor, Quagga may crash, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2010-2949

When processing certain crafted AS paths, Quagga would crash with a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service. In some configurations, such crafted AS paths could be relayed by intermediate BGP routers.

In addition, this update contains a reliability fix: Quagga will no longer advertise confederation-related AS paths to non-confederation peers, and reject unexpected confederation-related AS paths by resetting the session with the BGP peer which is advertising them. (Previously, such AS paths would trigger resets of unrelated BGP sessions.)

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.10-1lenny3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.17-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga package.");
