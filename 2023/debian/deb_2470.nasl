As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to upgrade the wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been impacted along the way. We recommend that users check their install before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.
