  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was discovered that node-xmldom, a standard XML DOM (Level2 CORE) implementation in pure javascript, processed ill-formed XML, which may result in bugs and security holes in downstream applications.

CVE-2021-21366

xmldom versions 0.4.0 and older do not correctly preserve system identifiers, FPIs or namespaces when repeatedly parsing and serializing maliciously crafted documents. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications.

CVE-2022-39353

Mark Gollnick discovered that xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to the childNodes collection of the Document, without reporting or throwing any error. This breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node in the tree, and may open security holes such as CVE-2022-39299 in downstream applications.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version 0.1.27+ds-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your node-xmldom packages.

For the detailed security status of node-xmldom please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
