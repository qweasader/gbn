CVE-2020-6829

When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point multiplication algorithm was used, which leaked partial information about the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

CVE-2020-12400

When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack.

CVE-2020-12401

During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

CVE-2020-12403

A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads. This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length.

CVE-2023-0767

Christian Holler discovered that incorrect handling of PKCS 12 Safe Bag attributes may result in execution of arbitrary code if a specially crafted PKCS 12 certificate bundle is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version 2:3.42.1-1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

For the detailed security status of nss please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
