CVE-2016-7980

Nicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the valider_xml action of SPIP. This allows remote attackers to make use of potential additional vulnerabilities such as the one described in CVE-2016-7998.

CVE-2016-7981

Nicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a reflected cross-site scripting attack (XSS) vulnerability in the validater_xml action of SPIP. An attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability to inject arbitrary code by tricking an administrator to open a malicious link.

CVE-2016-7982

Nicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a file enumeration / path traversal attack in the validator_xml action of SPIP. An attacker could use this to enumerate files in an arbitrary directory on the file system.

CVE-2016-7998

Nicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a possible PHP code execution vulnerability in the template compiler/composer function of SPIP. In combination with the XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities described in this advisory, a remote attacker could take advantage of this to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

CVE-2016-7999

Nicolas Chatelain of Sysdream Labs discovered a server side request forgery in the valider_xml action of SPIP. Attackers could take advantage of this vulnerability to send HTTP or FTP requests to remote servers that they don't have direct access to, possibly bypassing access controls such as a firewall.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 2.1.17-1+deb7u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your spip packages.
