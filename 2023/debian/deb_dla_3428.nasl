  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"node-nth-check, is a NodeJS module module used to parse and compile nth-checks, as they are found in CSS 3's nth-child() and nth-last-of-type() functions.

This module was vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service used for parsing.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.1-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your node-nth-check packages.

For the detailed security status of node-nth-check please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
