* keystone: See [link moved to references] for further information.

* libspring-java: See [link moved to references] for further information.

* guacamole-client: See [link moved to references] for further information.

* gpac: See [link moved to references] for further information.

* ansible: Lack of an effective test suite makes proper support impossible.

* mysql-connector-java: Details of security vulnerabilities are not disclosed. MySQL has been replaced by MariaDB. We recommend to use mariadb-connector-java instead.

* ckeditor3: See [link moved to references] for further information.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version 1:9+2022.06.02.

We recommend that you upgrade your debian-security-support packages.

For the detailed security status of debian-security-support please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
