  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"libapache2-mod-auth-mellon, a SAML 2.0 authentication module for Apache, were reported to have the following vulnerabilities.

CVE-2019-13038

mod_auth_mellon had an Open Redirect via the login?ReturnTo= substring, as demonstrated by omitting the // after http: in the target URL.

CVE-2021-3639

mod_auth_mellon did not sanitize logout URLs properly. This issue could be used by an attacker to facilitate phishing attacks by tricking users into visiting a trusted web application URL that redirects to an external and potentially malicious server.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version 0.14.2-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-auth-mellon packages.

For the detailed security status of libapache2-mod-auth-mellon please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
