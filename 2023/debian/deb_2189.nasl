  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-1108

Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly implement JavaScript dialogs, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2011-1109

Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly process nodes in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) stylesheets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a stale pointer.

CVE-2011-1113

Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 on 64-bit Linux platforms does not properly perform pickle deserialization, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2011-1114

Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly handle tables, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a stale node.

CVE-2011-1115

Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly render tables, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a stale pointer.

CVE-2011-1121

Integer overflow in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving a TEXTAREA element.

CVE-2011-1122

The WebGL implementation in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors, aka Issue 71960.

In addition, this upload fixes the following issues (they don't have a CVE id yet):

Out-of-bounds read in text searching. [69640]

Memory corruption in SVG fonts. [72134]

Memory corruption with counter nodes. [69628]

Stale node in box layout. [70027]

Cross-origin error message leak with workers. [70336]

Stale pointer in table painting. [72028]

Stale pointer with SVG cursors. [73746]

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 6.0.472.63~r59945-5+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed version 10.0.648.127~r76697-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.");
