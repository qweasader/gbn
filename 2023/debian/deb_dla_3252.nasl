CVE-2020-8813

Askar discovered that an authenticated guest user with the graph real-time privilege could execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, via shell meta-characters in a cookie.

CVE-2020-23226

Jing Chen discovered multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in several pages, which can lead to information disclosure.

CVE-2020-25706

joelister discovered an Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in templates_import.php, which can lead to information disclosure.

CVE-2022-0730

It has been discovered that Cacti authentication can be bypassed when LDAP anonymous binding is enabled.

CVE-2022-46169

Stefan Schiller discovered a command injection vulnerability, allowing an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected (which is likely the case on a production instance) for any monitored device.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version 1.2.2+ds1-2+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.

For the detailed security status of cacti please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
