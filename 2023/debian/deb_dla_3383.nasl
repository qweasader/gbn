file.copy operations in GruntJS were vulnerable to a TOCTOU ('time-of-check vs. time-of-use') race condition that could have led to arbitrary file writes in GitHub repositories. This could have then led to local privilege escalation if a lower-privileged user had write access to both source and destination directories, as the lower-privileged user could have created a symlink to the GruntJS user's ~/.bashrc configuration file (etc).

CVE-2022-1537

file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.

For Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.1-8+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your grunt packages.
