CVE-2022-4515

A flaw was found in Exuberant Ctags in the way it handles the '-o' option. This option specifies the tag filename. A crafted tag filename specified in the command line or in the configuration file results in arbitrary command execution because the externalSortTags() in sort.c calls the system(3) function in an unsafe way.

For Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version 1:5.9~svn20110310-12+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your exuberant-ctags packages.
