Other non-security bug fixes included in this version update from 4.1.75 to 4.1.90:

Build with Java 11 on ix86 architecture in order to avoid build failures
Fix HttpHeaders.names for non-String headers Fix FlowControlHandler behaviour to pass read events when auto-reading is turned off Fix brotli compression Fix a bug in FlowControlHandler that broke auto-read Fix a potential memory leak bug has been in the pooled allocator Fix a scalability issue caused by instanceof and check-cast checks that lead to false-sharing on the
 Klass::secondary_super_cache field in the JVM Fix a bug in our PEMParser when PEM files have multiple objects, and BouncyCastle is on the classpath Fix several NullPointerException bugs Fix a regression SslContext private key loading Fix a bug in SslContext private key reading fall-back path Fix a buffer leak regression in HttpClientCodec Fix a bug where some HttpMessage implementations, that also implement HttpContent, were not handled correctly Fix epoll bug when receiving zero-sized datagrams Fix a bug in SslHandler so handlerRemoved works properly even if handlerAdded throws an exception Fix an issue that allowed the multicast methods on EpollDatagramChannel to be called outside of an event-loop
 thread Fix a bug where an OPT record was added to DNS queries that already had such a record Fix a bug that caused an error when files uploaded with HTTP POST contained a backslash in their name Fix an issue in the BlockHound integration that could occasionally cause NetUtil to be reported as performing
 blocking operation. A similar BlockHound issue was fixed for the JdkSslContext Fix a bug that prevented preface or settings frames from being flushed, when an HTTP2 connection was established
 with prior-knowledge Fix a bug where Netty fails to load a shaded native library Fix and relax overly strict HTTP/2 header validation check that was rejecting requests from Chrome and Firefox Fix OpenSSL and BoringSSL implementations to respect the jdk.tls.client.protocols and jdk.tls.server.protocols
 system properties, making them react to these in the same way the JDK SSL provider does Fix inconsitencies in how epoll, kqueue, and NIO handle RDHUP For a more detailed list of changes please consult the official release notes:
