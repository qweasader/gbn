podman was updated to version 4.3.1:

4.3.1:

Bugfixes

Fixed a deadlock between the `podman ps` and `podman container inspect`
 commands

Misc

Updated the containers/image library to v5.23.1

4.3.0:

Features

A new command, `podman generate spec`, has been added, which creates a
 JSON struct based on a given container that can be used with the Podman
 REST API to create containers.

A new command, `podman update`, has been added,which makes changes to
 the resource limits of existing containers. Please note that these
 changes do not persist if the container is restarted

A new command, `podman kube down`, has been added, which removes pods
 and containers created by the given Kubernetes YAML (functionality is
 identical to `podman kube play --down`, but it now has its own command).

The `podman kube play` command now supports Kubernetes secrets using
 Podman's secrets backend.

Systemd-managed pods created by the `podman kube play` command now
 integrate with sd-notify, using the `io.containers.sdnotify` annotation
 (or `io.containers.sdnotify/$name` for specific containers).

Systemd-managed pods created by `podman kube play` can now be
 auto-updated, using the `io.containers.auto-update` annotation (or
 `io.containers.auto-update/$name` for specific containers).

The `podman kube play` command can now read YAML from URLs, e.g. `podman
 kube play https://example.com/demo.yml`

The `podman kube play` command now supports the `emptyDir` volume type

The `podman kube play` command now supports the `HostUsers` field in the
 pod spec.

The `podman play kube` command now supports `binaryData` in ConfigMaps.

The `podman pod create` command can now set additional resource limits
 for pods using the new `--memory-swap`, `--cpuset-mems`,
 `--device-read-bps`, `--device-write-bps`, `--blkio-weight`,
 `--blkio-weight-device`, and `--cpu-shares` options.

The `podman machine init` command now supports a new option,
 `--username`, to set the username that will be used to connect to the VM
 as a non-root user

The `podman volume create` command's `-o timeout=` option can now set a
 timeout of 0, indicating volume plugin operations will never time out.

Added support for a new volume driver, `image`, which allows volumes to
 be created that are backed by images.

The `podman run` and `podman create` commands support a new option,
 `--env-merge`, allowing environment variables to be specified relative
 to other environment variables in the image (e.g. `podman run
 --env-merge 'PATH=$PATH:/my/app' ...`)

The `podman run` and `podman create` commands support a new option,
 `--on-failure`, to allow action to be taken when a container fails
 health checks, with the following supported actions: `none` (take no
 action, the default), `kill` (kill the container), `restart` (restart
 the container), and `stop` (stop the container).
