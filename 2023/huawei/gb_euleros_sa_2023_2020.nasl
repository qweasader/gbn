Use After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2.(CVE-2023-1281)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA over infiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms.(CVE-2021-3923)

A race problem was found in fs/proc/task_mmu.c in the memory management sub-component in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with user privilege to cause a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1582)

A slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur when assoc_info->req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1380)

do_tls_getsockopt in net/tls/tls_main.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.6 lacks a lock_sock call, leading to a race condition (with a resultant use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference).(CVE-2023-28466)

A remote denial of service vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC kernel module. The while loop in tipc_link_xmit() hits an unknown state while attempting to parse SKBs, which are not in the queue. Sending two small UDP packets to a system with a UDP bearer results in the CPU utilization for the system to instantly spike to 100%, causing a denial of service condition.(CVE-2023-1390)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the az6027 driver in drivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c in the Linux Kernel. The message from user space is not checked properly before transferring into the device. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.(CVE-2023-28328)

A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Linux Kernel (Operating System) (the affected version is unknown). This vulnerability affects the function tipc_conn_close of the file net/tipc/topsrv.c of the component Cache Handler. Applying a patch is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at git.kernel.org.(CVE-2023-1382)
