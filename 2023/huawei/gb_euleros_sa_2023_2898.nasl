This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a double-free while cleaning up vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all, which could also lead to a kernel information leak problem.(CVE-2023-4387)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in the networking sub-component in vmxnet3 in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with normal user privilege to cause a denial of service due to a missing sanity check during cleanup.(CVE-2023-4459)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in dbFree in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in the journaling file system (JFS) in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing sanity check.(CVE-2023-4385)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the siano smsusb module in the Linux kernel. The bug occurs during device initialization when the siano device is plugged in. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system, causing a denial of service condition.(CVE-2023-4132)

A buffer overrun vulnerability was found in the netback driver in Xen due to an unusual split packet. This flaw allows an unprivileged guest to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the host by sending network packets to the backend, causing the backend to crash.(CVE-2023-34319)

A use-after-free flaw was found in nfc_llcp_find_local in net/nfc/llcp_core.c in NFC in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local user with special privileges to impact a kernel information leak issue.(CVE-2023-3863)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_net.c has a .disconnect versus dvb_device_open race condition that leads to a use-after-free.(CVE-2022-45886)

In multiple functions of binder.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2023-21255)

A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DECnet networking protocol. This issue could allow a remote user to crash the system.(CVE-2023-3338)

A null pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) driver. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.(CVE-2023-3358)

A use-after-free flaw was found in net/sched/cls_fw.c in classifiers (cls_fw, cls_u32, and cls_route) in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to perform a local privilege escalation due to incorrect handling of the existing filter, leading to a kernel information leak issue.(CVE-2023-4128)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP functionality. This issue could allow a local user to bypass network filters and gain ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
