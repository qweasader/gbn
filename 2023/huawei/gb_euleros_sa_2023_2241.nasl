  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"libtiff's tiffcrop tool has a uint32_t underflow which leads to out of bounds read and write in the extractContigSamples8bits routine. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop could trigger this flaw, most likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted file with tiffcrop. Triggering this flaw could cause a crash or potentially further exploitation.(CVE-2022-2869)

A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of Tiffsplit v4.4.0. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file.(CVE-2022-34526)

Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f3a5e010.(CVE-2022-2057)

Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f3a5e010.(CVE-2022-2056)

Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f3a5e010.(CVE-2022-2058)

libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a uint32_t underflow that can lead to out of bounds read and write. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters) could cause a crash or in some cases, further exploitation.(CVE-2022-2867)

libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a improper input validation flaw that can lead to out of bounds read and ultimately cause a crash if an attacker is able to supply a crafted file to tiffcrop.(CVE-2022-2868)

LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds read in extractImageSection in tools/tiffcrop.c:6905, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 48d6ece8.(CVE-2022-2953)

LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemcpy in libtiff/tif_unix.c:346 when called from extractImageSection, tools/tiffcrop.c:6860, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191.(CVE-2022-3627)

LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemset in libtiff/tif_unix.c:340 when called from processCropSelections, tools/tiffcrop.c:7619, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191.(CVE-2022-3626)

Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff library Version 4.4.0 allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application crash, potential information ...
