There is an infoleak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_parse_conf_req function which can be used to leak kernel pointers remotely. We recommend upgrading past commit [link moved to references](CVE-2022-42895)

There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_connect and l2cap_le_connect_req functions which may allow code execution and leaking kernel memory (respectively) remotely via Bluetooth. A remote attacker could execute code leaking kernel memory via Bluetooth if within proximity of the victim.

A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function vsock_connect of the file net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211930 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3629)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel Broadcom Full MAC Wi-Fi driver. This issue occurs when a user connects to a malicious USB device. This can allow a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges.(CVE-2022-3628)

A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function devlink_param_set/devlink_param_get of the file net/core/devlink.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211929 was assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3625)

A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function inet6_stream_ops/inet6_dgram_ops of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211090 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3567)

drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory.(CVE-2022-43750)

A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this vulnerability is the function l2cap_reassemble_sdu of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free.
