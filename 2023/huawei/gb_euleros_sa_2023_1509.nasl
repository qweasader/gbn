Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff library Version 4.4.0 allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application crash, potential information disclosure or any other context-dependent impact(CVE-2022-3570)

libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a improper input validation flaw that can lead to out of bounds read and ultimately cause a crash if an attacker is able to supply a crafted file to tiffcrop.(CVE-2022-2868)

libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a uint32_t underflow that can lead to out of bounds read and write. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters) could cause a crash or in some cases, further exploitation.(CVE-2022-2867)

libtiff's tiffcrop tool has a uint32_t underflow which leads to out of bounds read and write in the extractContigSamples8bits routine. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop could trigger this flaw, most likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted file with tiffcrop. Triggering this flaw could cause a crash or potentially further exploitation.(CVE-2022-2869)

LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds read in extractImageSection in tools/tiffcrop.c:6905, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 48d6ece8.(CVE-2022-2953)");
