An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in saa7134_finidev in drivers/media/pci/saa7134/saa7134-core.c.(CVE-2023-35823)

CVE-2023-3327 kernel: saa7134: race condition leading to use-after-free in saa7134_finidev()(CVE-2023-3327)

An issue was discovered in fl_set_geneve_opt in net/sched/cls_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6.3.7. It allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.(CVE-2023-35788)

An out of bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel in relay_file_read_start_pos in kernel/relay.c in the relayfs. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information.(CVE-2023-3268)

A use after free issue was discovered in driver/firewire in outbound_phy_packet_callback in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw a local attacker with special privilege may cause a use after free problem when queue_event() fails.(CVE-2023-3159)

A use-after-free flaw was found in r592_remove in drivers/memstick/host/r592.c in media access in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system at device disconnect, possibly leading to a kernel information leak.(CVE-2023-3141)

A flaw was found in the Framebuffer Console (fbcon) in the Linux Kernel. When providing font->width and font->height greater than 32 to fbcon_set_font, since there are no checks in place, a shift-out-of-bounds occurs leading to undefined behavior and possible denial of service.(CVE-2023-3161)

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.3. There is an out-of-bounds read in crc16 in lib/crc16.c when called from fs/ext4/super.c because ext4_group_desc_csum does not properly check an offset. NOTE: this is disputed by third parties because the kernel is not intended to defend against attackers with the stated 'When modifying the block device while it is mounted by the filesystem' access.(CVE-2023-34256)

A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tls_is_tx_ready() incorrectly checks for list emptiness, potentially accessing a type confused entry to the list_head, leaking the last byte of the confused field that overlaps with rec->tx_ready.(CVE-2023-1075)

An issue was discovered in netfilter in the Linux kernel before 5.10. There can be a use-after-free in the packet processing context, because the per-CPU sequence count is mishandled during concurrent iptables rules replacement. This could be exploited with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in an unprivileged namespace. NOTE: cc00bca was reverted in 5.12.(CVE-2020-36694)

In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
