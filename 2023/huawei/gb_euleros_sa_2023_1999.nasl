  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA over infiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms.(CVE-2021-3923)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3. lib/seq_buf.c has a seq_buf_putmem_hex buffer overflow.(CVE-2023-28772)

A race problem was found in fs/proc/task_mmu.c in the memory management sub-component in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with user privilege to cause a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1582)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be triggered in asus_kbd_backlight_set when plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device, which advertises itself as an Asus device. Similarly to the previous known CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct may be scheduled by the LED controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free on the struct asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may exploit the issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data.(CVE-2023-1079)

In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference.(CVE-2023-1095)

A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1074)

A memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel's human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-1073)

There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c(CVE-2023-0461)
