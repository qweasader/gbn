  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Use After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2.(CVE-2023-1281)

do_tls_getsockopt in net/tls/tls_main.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.6 lacks a lock_sock call, leading to a race condition (with a resultant use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference).(CVE-2023-28466)

A use-after-free flaw was found in vhost_net_set_backend in drivers/vhost/net.c in virtio network subcomponent in the Linux kernel due to a double fget. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system, and could even lead to a kernel information leak problem.(CVE-2023-1838)

possibility of deadlock in libbpf function sock_hash_delete_elem(CVE-2023-0160)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA over infiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms.(CVE-2021-3923)

A race problem was found in fs/proc/task_mmu.c in the memory management sub-component in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with user privilege to cause a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1582)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using a specific networking configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action 'mirred') a local unprivileged user could trigger a CPU soft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or SCTP) does a retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition.(CVE-2022-4269)");
