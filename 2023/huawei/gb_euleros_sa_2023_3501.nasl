  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An array indexing vulnerability was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A missing macro could lead to a miscalculation of the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-42753)

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.When the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc, sending network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug and lack of error checking in agg_dequeue().We recommend upgrading past commit 8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8.(CVE-2023-4921)

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.When u32_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.We recommend upgrading past commit 3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81.(CVE-2023-4208)

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.When fw_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.We recommend upgrading past commit 76e42ae831991c828cffa8c37736ebfb831ad5ec.(CVE-2023-4207)

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_route component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.When route4_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.We recommend upgrading past commit b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8.(CVE-2023-4206)
