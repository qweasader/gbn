  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c(CVE-2023-0461)

A memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel's human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-1073)

A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/transceiver driver was found in the way user detaching rc device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.(CVE-2023-1118)

A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service.(CVE-2023-1074)

A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.(CVE-2023-1076)

The current implementation of the prctl syscall does not issue an IBPB immediately during the syscall. The ib_prctl_set function updates the Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL MSR on the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only issued on the next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctl syscall. The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigation via prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176. We recommend upgrading past commit a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96(CVE-2023-0045)

A double-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The Intel GVT-g graphics driver triggers VGA card system resource overload, causing a fail in the intel_gvt_dma_map_guest_page function. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.(CVE-2022-3707)");
