A use-after-free flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.19.2. This issue occurs in cmd_hdl_filter in drivers/staging/rtl8712/rtl8712_cmd.c, allowing an attacker to launch a local denial of service attack and gain escalation of privileges.(CVE-2022-4095)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel Broadcom Full MAC Wi-Fi driver. This issue occurs when a user connects to a malicious USB device. This can allow a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges(CVE-2022-3628)

A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function vsock_connect of the file net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211930 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3629)

A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function inet6_stream_ops/inet6_dgram_ops of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211090 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3567)

drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory.(CVE-2022-43750)

A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function area_cache_get of the file drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfpcore/nfp_cppcore.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211045 was assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3545)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service.(CVE-2022-3586)

A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function tcp_getsockopt/tcp_setsockopt of the component TCP Handler. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211089 was assigned to this vulnerability.(CVE-2022-3566)

A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function intr_callback of the file drivers/net/usb/r8152.c of the component BPF.
