  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"curl's HSTS cache saving behaves wrongly when multiple URLs are requested in parallel. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly fail when multiple transfers are done in parallel as the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recently completed transfer. A later HTTP-only transfer to the earlier host name would then not get upgraded properly to HSTS.(CVE-2023-23915)

curl's HSTS functionality fail when multiple URLs are requested serially. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would however suprisingly be ignored by subsequent transfers when done on the same command line because the state would not be properly carried on.(CVE-2023-23914)

curl supports 'chained' HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable 'links' in this 'decompression chain' was capped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by using many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a 'malloc bomb', making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.(CVE-2023-23916)");
