  Keep in mind that robots are harvesting such open servers on Internet, so you cannot hope that
  you will stay hidden for long.

  Unwanted connections could waste your bandwidth or put you into legal trouble if outsiders use your server
  to read and/or post 'politically incorrects' articles.

  As it is very common to have IP based authentication, this might be a false positive if the scanner is
  among the allowed source addresses.");
