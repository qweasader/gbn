  script_tag(name:"vuldetect", value:"Checks if a vulnerable version is present on the target host.");

  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"S4U2Self is an extension to Kerberos used in Active Directory to allow
  a service to request a kerberos ticket to itself from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) for a
  non-Kerberos authenticated user (principal in Kerboros parlance). This is useful to allow internal
  code paths to be standardized around Kerberos.

  S4U2Proxy (constrained-delegation) is an extension of this mechanism allowing this impersonation to a
  second service over the network. It allows a privileged server that obtained a S4U2Self ticket to itself
  to then assert the identity of that principal to a second service and present itself as that principal
  to get services from the second service.

  There is a flaw in Samba's AD DC in the Heimdal KDC. When the Heimdal KDC checks the checksum that is
  placed on the S4U2Self packet by the server to protect the requested principal against modification, it
  does not confirm that the checksum algorithm that protects the user name (principal) in the request is
  keyed.");

  script_tag(name:"impact", value:"This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker who can intercept the request
  to the KDC to modify the packet by replacing the user name (principal) in the request with any desired
  user name (principal) that exists in the KDC and replace the checksum protecting that name with a CRC32
  checksum (which requires no prior knowledge to compute).

  This would allow a S4U2Self ticket requested on behalf of user name (principal) user@EXAMPLE.COM to any
  service to be changed to a S4U2Self ticket with a user name (principal) of Administrator@EXAMPLE.COM.
  This ticket would then contain the PAC of the modified user name (principal).");
