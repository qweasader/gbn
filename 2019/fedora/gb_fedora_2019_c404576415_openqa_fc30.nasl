an error in early boot even before init is executed.

openQA is an automated test tool that makes it possible to test the whole
installation process of an operating system. It uses virtual machines to
reproduce the process, check the output (both serial console and screen) in
every step and send the necessary keystrokes and commands to proceed to the
next. openQA can check whether the system can be installed, whether it works
properly in &#39, live&#39, mode, whether applications work or whether the system
responds as expected to different installation options and commands.

Even more importantly, openQA can run several combinations of tests for every
revision of the operating system, reporting the errors detected for each
combination of hardware configuration, installation options and variant of the
operating system.");
