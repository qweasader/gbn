disk-like things) over the network.

nbdkit is a toolkit for creating NBD servers.

The key features are:

  * Multithreaded NBD server written in C with good performance.

  * Minimal dependencies for the basic server.

  * Liberal license (BSD) allows nbdkit to be linked to proprietary
  libraries or included in proprietary code.

  * Well-documented, simple plugin API with a stable ABI guarantee.
  Lets you to export 'unconventional' block devices easily.

  * You can write plugins in C or many other languages.

  * Filters can be stacked in front of plugins to transform the output.

In Fedora, &#39, nbdkit&#39, is a meta-package which pulls in the core server
and a useful subset of plugins and filters.

If you want just the server, install &#39, nbdkit-server&#39, .

To develop plugins, install the &#39, nbdkit-devel&#39, package and start by
reading the nbdkit(1) and nbdkit-plugin(3) manual pages.");
