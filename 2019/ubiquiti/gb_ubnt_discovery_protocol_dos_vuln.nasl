  The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a valid query request to a UBNT server
  with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address. Since UBNT Discovery Protocol uses UDP
  this is trivialy done. When the UBNT server sends the response, it is sent instead to the victim.
  Because the size of the response is typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker
  is able to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the victim (the amplification factor is
  around 30-35x). By leveraging a botnet to perform additional spoofed queries, an attacker can
  produce an overwhelming amount of traffic with little effort.");
