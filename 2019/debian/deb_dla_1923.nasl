CVE-2015-3908

A potential man-in-the-middle attack associated with insusfficient X.509 certificate verification. Ansible did not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

CVE-2015-6240

A symlink attack that allows local users to escape a restricted environment (chroot or jail) via a symlink attack.

CVE-2018-10875

A fix potential arbitrary code execution resulting from reading ansible.cfg from a world-writable current working directory. This condition now causes ansible to emit a warning and ignore the ansible.cfg in the world-writable current working directory.

CVE-2019-10156

Information disclosure through unexpected variable substitution.

For Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version 1.7.2+dfsg-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.
