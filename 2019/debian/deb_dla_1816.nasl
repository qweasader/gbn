CVE-2019-12248

An attacker could send a malicious email to an OTRS system. If a logged in agent user quotes it, the email could cause the browser to load external image resources.

CVE-2019-12497

In the customer or external frontend, personal information of agents can be disclosed like Name and mail address in external notes.

For Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version 3.3.18-1+deb8u10.

We recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.
