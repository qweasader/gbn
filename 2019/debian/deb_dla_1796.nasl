CVE-2018-1000074

Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in owner command that can result in code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via victim must run the `gem owner` command on a gem with a specially crafted YAML file

CVE-2018-1000075

an infinite loop caused by negative size vulnerability in ruby gem package tar header that can result in a negative size could cause an infinite loop

CVE-2018-1000076

Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability in package.rb that can result in a mis-signed gem could be installed, as the tarball would contain multiple gem signatures.

CVE-2018-1000077

Improper Input Validation vulnerability in ruby gems specification homepage attribute that can result in a malicious gem could set an invalid homepage URL

CVE-2018-1000078

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in gem server display of homepage attribute that can result in XSS. This attack appear to be exploitable via the victim must browse to a malicious gem on a vulnerable gem server

CVE-2019-8321

Gem::UserInteraction#verbose calls say without escaping, escape sequence injection is possible

CVE-2019-8322

The gem owner command outputs the contents of the API response directly to stdout. Therefore, if the response is crafted, escape sequence injection may occur

CVE-2019-8323

Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response may output the API response to stdout as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response, escape sequence injection may occur.

CVE-2019-8324

A crafted gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker could inject arbitrary code to the stub line of gemspec

CVE-2019-8325

Gem::CommandManager#run calls alert_error without escaping, escape sequence injection is possible. (There are many ways to cause an error.)

For Debian 8 Jessie, these problems have been fixed in version 1.5.6-9+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your jruby packages.
