There is a zip-like file in the Firefox distribution, omni.ja, which is a zip container with the central directory placed at the start of the file instead of after the local entries as required by the zip standard. This update now permits such containers to not raise a zip bomb alert, where in fact there are no overlaps.

For Debian 8 Jessie, this problem has been fixed in version 6.0-16+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.
