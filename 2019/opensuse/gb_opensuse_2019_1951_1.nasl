  libTMCG was updated to version 1.3.18

  * This release is two-fold: first, it fixes some bugs (e.g. iterated S2K)
  of the OpenPGP interface, and second, it adds functionality for handling
  v5 keys and signatures (see RFC 4880bis-07).

  Update to version 1.3.17

  * VTMF, ASTC, DKG, VRHE, EOTP, COM, VSS: make CheckGroup() more robust

  * VSSHE: security bugfix for Verify_[non]interactive_[_publiccoin]

  * mpz_spowm: added check for correct base in fast exponentiation

  * mpz_sqrtm: remove unused parameter in tmcg_mpz_qrmn_p()

  * configure.ac: added compiler option '-Wextra'

  * mpz_sprime: added tmcg_mpz_smprime() with increased B = 80000

  * RFC4880: changed type of tmcg_openpgp_mem_alloc to unsigned long

  Update to version 1.3.16

  * changed constant TMCG_MAX_CARDS (decreased by factor 2)

  * changed formulas for TMCG_MAX_VALUE_CHARS and TMCG_MAX_KEY_CHARS

  * RFC4880: added support of Preferred AEAD Algorithms [RFC 4880bis]

  * RFC4880: added output for key usage 'timestamping' [RFC 4880bis]

  * RFC4880: changed tmcg_openpgp_byte_t: unsigned char -> uint8_t

  * RFC4880: added PacketAeadEncode() [RFC 4880bis]

  * RFC4880: added SymmetricDecryptAEAD() and SymmetricEncryptAEAD()

  * changed formula for TMCG_MAX_KEYBITS (increased by factor 2)

  * mpz_srandom: bugfix in Botan code branch of mpz_grandomb()

  Update to version 1.3.15:

  * This is a maintenance release that fixes some bugs, e.g. in the Botan
  support of functions from module mpz_srandom. Moreover, some interfaces
  of the OpenPGP implementation have been added and removed. For some
  modules of LibTMCG a basic exception handling has been introduced.

  Update to version 1.3.14:

  * With this release three additional parameters for the control of secure
  memory allocation have been added to init_libTMCG(). They are explained
  in the reference manual. Moreover, the OpenPGP interface has been
  enhanced in several way, e.g., ECDH, ECDSA and EdDSA are supported now.

  Update to 1.3.13:

  * Lots of major improvements for undocumented OpenPGP interface

  * PRNG from Botan is used as additional source of randomness

  * SHA3 is emulated if runtime version of libgcrypt is too old

  dkgpg was updated to version 1.1.3:

  * This is a bugfix release that includes only three minor improvements: a
  direct-key signature (0x1f) for the primary key is added by default such
  that restricting key servers (e.g. keys.openpgp.org) can deliver a
  cryptographically checkable key without verification of any included
  user ID or without appended subkey. The command line i ...
