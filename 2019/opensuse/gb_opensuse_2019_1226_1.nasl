  Security issues fixed:

  - CVE-2018-19967: Fixed HLE constructs that allowed guests to lock up the
  host, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). (XSA-282) (bsc#1114988)

  - CVE-2019-6778: Fixed a heap buffer overflow in tcp_emu() found in slirp
  (bsc#1123157).

  - Fixed an issue which could allow malicious or buggy guests with passed
  through PCI devices to  be able to escalate their privileges, crash the
  host, or access data belonging to other guests. Additionally memory
  leaks were also possible (bsc#1126140).

  - Fixed a race condition issue which could allow malicious PV guests to
  escalate their privilege to that
  of the hypervisor (bsc#1126141).

  - Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious unprivileged guest
  userspace process to escalate its privilege to that of other userspace
  processes in the same guest and potentially thereby to that
  of the guest operating system (bsc#1126201).

  - CVE-2019-9824: Fixed an information leak in SLiRP networking
  implementation which could allow a user/process to read uninitialised
  stack memory contents (bsc#1129623).

  - CVE-2018-19961 CVE-2018-19962: Fixed insufficient TLB flushing /
  improper large page mappings with AMD IOMMUs (XSA-275)(bsc#1115040).

  - CVE-2018-19965: Fixed denial of service issue from attempting to use
  INVPCID with a non-canonical addresses (XSA-279)(bsc#1115045).

  - CVE-2018-19966: Fixed issue introduced by XSA-240 that could have caused
  conflicts with shadow paging (XSA-280)(bsc#1115047).

  - Fixed an issue which could allow malicious PV guests may cause a host
  crash or gain access to data pertaining to other guests.Additionally,
  vulnerable configurations are likely to be unstable even in the absence
  of an attack (bsc#1126198).

  - Fixed multiple access violations introduced by XENMEM_exchange hypercall
  which could allow a single PV guest to leak arbitrary amounts of memory,
  leading to a denial of service (bsc#1126192).

  - Fixed an issue which could allow malicious 64bit PV guests to cause a
  host crash (bsc#1127400).

  - Fixed an issue which could allow malicious or buggy x86 PV guest kernels
  to mount a Denial of Service attack affecting the whole system
  (bsc#1126197).

  - Fixed an issue which could allow an untrusted PV domain with access to a
  physical device to DMA into its own pagetables leading to privilege
  escalation (bsc#1126195).

  - Fixed an issue which could allow a malicious or buggy x86 PV guest
  kernels can mount a Denial of Service attack affecting the whole system
  (bsc#1126196).
