  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for apache2 fixes the following issues:

  * CVE-2019-0211: A flaw in the Apache HTTP Server allowed less-privileged
  child processes or threads to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
  of the parent process. Attackers with control over CGI scripts or
  extension modules run by the server could have abused this issue to
  potentially gain super user privileges. [bsc#1131233]

  * CVE-2019-0220: The Apache HTTP server did not use a consistent strategy
  for URL normalization throughout all of its components. In particular,
  consecutive slashes were not always collapsed. Attackers could
  potentially abuse these inconsistencies to by-pass access control
  mechanisms and thus gain unauthorized access to protected parts of the
  service. [bsc#1131241]

  * CVE-2019-0217: A race condition in Apache's 'mod_auth_digest' when
  running in a threaded server could have allowed users with valid
  credentials to authenticate using another username, bypassing configured
  access control restrictions. [bsc#1131239]

  * CVE-2019-0197: When HTTP/2 support was enabled in the Apache server for
  a 'http' host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a 'https' host, an
  Upgrade request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the first request
  on a connection could lead to a misconfiguration and crash. This issue
  could have been abused to mount a denial-of-service attack. Servers that
  never enabled the h2 protocol or that only enabled it for https: and did
  not configure the 'H2Upgrade on' are unaffected. [bsc#1131245]

  * CVE-2019-0196: Through specially crafted network input the Apache's
  http/2 request handler could be lead to access previously freed memory
  while determining the method of a request. This resulted in the request
  being misclassified and thus being processed incorrectly. [bsc#1131237]
